SWB2 - [EXPERIMENTAL] A Modified Thornthwaite-Mather Soil-Water-Balance Code for Estimating Groundwater Recharge

>*DISCLAIMER*: This software is preliminary or provisional and is subject to revision. It is being provided to meet the need for timely best science. The software has not received final approval by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). No warranty, expressed or implied, is made by the USGS or the U.S. Government as to the functionality of the software and related material nor shall the fact of release constitute any such warranty. The software is provided on the condition that neither the USGS nor the U.S. Government shall be held liable for any damages resulting from the authorized or unauthorized use of the software. 

The Soil-Water-Balance (SWB) computer code has been developed to calculate spatial and temporal
 variations in groundwater recharge. The SWB model calculates recharge by use of commonly available 
 geographic information system (GIS) data layers in combination with tabular climatological data.
The code is based on a modified Thornthwaite-Mather soil-water-balance approach, with 
components of the soil-water balance calculated at a daily timestep. 
Recharge calculations are made on a rectangular grid of computational elements that may be 
easily imported into a regional groundwater-flow model. Recharge estimates calculated by
 the code may be output as daily, monthly, or annual values.
 
The experimental version in this repository incorporates some of the latest Fortran 2003/2008 features. This
 version is an INCOMPLETE WORK IN PROGRESS.
