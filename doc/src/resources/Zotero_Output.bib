Measurements were made for several moisture potentials in the range 0 {\textgreater} ψm ≥ −150 cm of water at several randomly selected sites per soil series. The morphological character of the soil series spanned a broad range, from sands to clay loam soils. The k characteristic of each series was mathematically described, and the series conductivity curves were related as a family of curves. By using multivariate discriminant analysis the series were grouped into classes of similar hydraulic behavior, based on the dispersion of moisture potential and hydraulic conductivity data within and between series. A 95\% prediction interval was constructed to include the range of conductivities to be expected at future sites.},

	series = {Scientific Investigations Report},
	abstract = {This report documents the computer program {INFIL}3.0, which is a grid-based, distributed-parameter, deterministic water-balance watershed model that calculates the temporal and spatial distribution of daily net infiltration of water across the lower boundary of the root zone. The bottom of the root zone is the estimated maximum depth below ground surface affected by evapotranspiration. In many field applications, net infiltration below the bottom of the root zone can be assumed to equal net recharge to an underlying water-table aquifer. The daily water balance simulated by {INFIL}3.0 includes precipitation as either rain or snow; snowfall accumulation, sublimation, and snowmelt; infiltration into the root zone; evapotranspiration from the root zone; drainage and water-content redistribution within the root-zone profile; surface-water runoff from, and run-on to, adjacent grid cells; and net infiltration across the bottom of the root zone.

The water-balance model uses daily climate records of precipitation and air temperature and a spatially distributed representation of drainage-basin characteristics defined by topography, geology, soils, and vegetation to simulate daily net infiltration at all locations, including stream channels with intermittent streamflow in response to runoff from rain and snowmelt. The model does not simulate streamflow originating as ground-water discharge. Drainage-basin characteristics are represented in the model by a set of spatially distributed input variables uniquely assigned to each grid cell of a model grid.

The report provides a description of the conceptual model of net infiltration on which the {INFIL}3.0 computer code is based and a detailed discussion of the methods by which {INFIL}3.0 simulates the net-infiltration process. The report also includes instructions for preparing input files necessary for an {INFIL}3.0 simulation, a description of the output files that are created as part of an {INFIL}3.0 simulation, and a sample problem that illustrates application of the code to a field setting. Brief descriptions of the main program routine and of each of the modules and subroutines of the {INFIL}3.0 code, as well as definitions of the variables used in each subroutine, are provided in an appendix.},

@thesis{arrington_mapping_2009,
	title = {Mapping infiltration rates in Dane County, Wisconsin},
	abstract = {Dane County, Wisconsin has experienced rapid population growth and development over the last 40 years. Groundwater pumping and loss of recharge associated with development have contributed to significant groundwater drawdown- up to 20m compared to predevelopment conditions. Infiltrating stormwater is a practice that may minimize recharge loss in developed areas, especially if the stormwater is directed to high-infiltration soils. The saturated hydraulic conductivity (K sat ), which is a measure of how easily a soil transmits water, can be used to compare the infiltration potential of different soils. Most Ksat estimates are based on measurements in which water flow is primarily through micropores, rather than macropores. However, macropore flow can dominate the infiltration rate when the soil is saturated, as it is likely to be in areas receiving stormwater runoff.

The objective of this study was to produce a relative infiltration map for Dane. County that is based on local infiltration measurements that do include macropore flow. Infiltration measurements were taken (50 sites, 124 measurements) and soil samples collected for a wide variety of soils and land uses across Dane County. Multiple regression analysis was done to examine relationships between K sat and soil and non-soil properties (landcover and topography). Percent sand and bulk density of the surface horizon were the two best soil property predictors of Ksat . Landcover was the best non-soil Ksat predictor. These relationships were used to develop a relative infiltration map for Dane County from existing geospatial data layers for soils, landcover and topography. Including landcover as a predictor of Ksat improves the accuracy of the regression model compared to the model based on soil properties alone (percent sand and bulk density) and also increases the spatial resolution of the relative infiltration map. This map is designed for use in township or watershed-scale land use planning. Local land use planners can use this information to identify the suitability of potential development areas for infiltration-based stormwater management.},

The degree to which the distribution of vegetation can be explained on the basis of climatic conditions depends in part on the proper selection of active climatic factors. Temperature and precipitation by themselves are poor descriptors of climate. Potential evapotranspiration, water surplus, and water deficit (combined in a moisture index) are found to be more useful. An analysis of the vegetation distribution in conterminous United States shows that the Thornthwaite moisture index and annual potential evapotranspiration are not only able to differentiate among the mid-latitude grassland, forest, and desert biochores but also to provide climatic limits for formation classes within each of the biochores. For example, it is possible to identify on the basis of numerical data an oak-hickory climate as distinct from the birch-maple, and a bunch grass climate distinct from the sagebrush. The problem of non-climatically controlled vegetation associations such as the low latitude pines and savanna are also discussed.},

	abstract = {A method for generating daily surfaces of temperature, precipitation, humidity, and radiation over large regions of complex terrain is presented. Required inputs include digital elevation data and observations of maximum temperature, minimum temperature and precipitation from ground-based meteorological stations. Our method is based on the spatial convolution of a truncated Gaussian weighting filter with the set of station locations. Sensitivity to the typical heterogeneous distribution of stations in complex terrain is accomplished with an iterative station density algorithm. Spatially and temporally explicit empirical analyses of the relationships of temperature and precipitation to elevation were performed, and the characteristic spatial and temporal scales of these relationships were explored. A daily precipitation occurrence algorithm is introduced, as a precursor to the prediction of daily precipitation amount. Surfaces of humidity (vapor pressure deficit) are generated as a function of the predicted daily minimum temperature and the predicted daily average daylight temperature. Daily surfaces of incident solar radiation are generated as a function of Sun-slope geometry and interpolated diurnal temperature range. The application of these methods is demonstrated over an area of approximately 400 000 detailed illustration of the parameterization process. A cross-validation analysis was performed, comparing predicted and observed daily and annual average values. Mean absolute errors ({MAE}) for predicted annual average maximum and minimum temperature were 0.7°C and 1.2°C, with biases of +0.1°C and −0.1°C, respectively. {MAE} for predicted annual total precipitation was 13.4 cm, or, expressed as a percentage of the observed annual totals, 19.3\%. The success rate for predictions of daily precipitation occurrence was 83.3\%. Particular attention was given to the predicted and observed relationships between precipitation frequency and intensity, and they were shown to be similar. We tested the sensitivity of these methods to prediction grid-point spacing, and found that areal averages were unchanged for grids ranging in spacing from 500 m to 32 km. We tested the dependence of the results on timestep, and found that the temperature prediction algorithms scale perfectly in this respect. Temporal scaling of precipitation predictions was complicated by the daily occurrence predictions, but very nearly the same predictions were obtained at daily and annual timesteps.},

The focus is on the well-studied Panola Mountain Research Watershed ({PMRW}), Georgia, {USA}. Recession analysis of discharge Q shows that while the relationship between {dQ}/dt and Q is approximately consistent with a linear reservoir for the hillslope, there is a deviation from linearity that becomes progressively larger with increasing spatial scale. To account for these scale differences conceptual models of streamflow recession are defined at both the hillslope scale and the watershed scale, and an assessment made as to whether models at the hillslope scale can be aggregated to be consistent with models at the watershed scale.},

	abstract = {The amount and spatial distribution of deep drainage (downward movement of water across the bottom of the root zone) and groundwater recharge affect the quantity and quality of increasingly limited groundwater in arid and semiarid regions. We synthesize research from the fields of ecology and hydrology to address the issue of deep drainage in arid and semiarid regions. We start with a recently developed hydrological model that accurately simulates soil water potential and geochemical profiles measured in thick ({\textgreater}50 m), unconsolidated vadose zones. Model results indicate that, since the climate change that marked the onset of the Holocene period 10 000-15 000 years ago, there has been no deep drainage in vegetated interdrainage areas and that continuous, relatively low ({\textless} - 1 {MPa}) soil water potentials have been maintained at depths of 2-3 m. A conceptual model consistent with these results proposes that the native, xeric-shrub-dominated, plant communities that gained dominance during the Holocene generated and maintained these conditions. We present three lines of ecological evidence that support the conceptual model. First, xeric shrubs have sufficiently deep rooting systems with low extraction limits to generate the modeled conditions. Second, the characteristic deep-rooted soil-plant systems store sufficient water to effectively buffer deep soil from climatic fluctuations in these dry environments, allowing stable conditions to persist for long periods of time. And third, adaptations resulting in deep, low-extraction-limit rooting systems confer significant advantages to xeric shrubs in arid and semiarid environments. We then consider conditions in arid and semiarid regions in which the conceptual model may not apply, leading to the expectation that portions of many arid and semiarid watersheds supply some deep drainage. Further ecohydrologic research is required to elucidate critical climatic and edaphic thresholds, evaluate the role of important physiological processes (such as hydraulic redistribution), and evaluate the role of deep roots in terms of carbon costs, nutrient uptake, and whole-plant development.},

The tools are special purpose {FORTRAN} programs interfaced with general-purpose raster and vector spatial analysis and relational data base management packages. The first phase of analysis is a conditioning phase that generates three data sets: the original {DEM} with depressions filled, a data set indicating the flow direction for each cell, and a flow accumulation data set in which each cell receives a value equal to the number of cells that drain to it. The original {DEM} and these three derivative data sets can then be processed in a variety of ways to optionally delineate drainage networks, overland paths, watersheds for user-specified locations, sub-watersheds for the major tributaries of a drainage network, or pour point linkages between watersheds. The computer-generated drainage lines and watershed polygons and the pour point linkage information can be transferred to vector-based geographic information systems for further analysis. Comparisons between these computer generated features and their manually delineated counterparts generally show close agreement, indicating that these software tools will save analyst time spent in manual interpretation and digitizing.},

	abstract = {A multi-criteria model evaluation protocol is presented to check the performance of rainfall-runoff models during model calibration and validation phases based on a high frequency (e.g. hourly, daily) river flow series. The multiple criteria or objectives are based on multiple and non-commensurable measures of information derived from river flow series by means of a number of sequential time series processing tasks. These include separation of the river flow series in subflows, split of the series in nearly independent quick and slow flow hydrograph periods, and the extraction of nearly independent peak and low flows. The protocol accounts for the statistical assumptions and requirements on independency and homoscedasticity of the model residuals, significantly advanced through the use of nearly independent flow values extracted from the flow series. Next to the separate evaluation of the subflow recessions, the quick and slow runoff peak and low values and event volumes, also the performance of the model in predicting extreme high and low flow statistics is validated. To support the time series processing tasks as well as the application of the multi-criteria model evaluation protocol, a Microsoft Excel-based tool ({WETSPRO}: Water Engineering Time Series {PROcessing} tool) has been developed. It is based on the assessment of graphical displays, which complement traditional goodness-of-fit statistics.},

These models include variants of the Thornthwaite-Mather model, the Palmer model, and the more recent Thomas abcd model. Prediction errors are relatively similar among the models. However, simulated values of state variables such as soil moisture storage differ substantially among the models, and fitted parameter values for different models sometimes indicated an entirely different type of basin response to precipitation. Some problems in parameter identification are noted, including difficulties in identifying an appropriate time lag factor for the Thornthwaite-Mather-type model for basins with little groundwater storage, very high correlations between upper and lower storages in the Palmer-type model, and large sensitivity of parameter a of the abcd model to bias in estimates of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. Modifications to the threshold concept of the Thornthwaite-Mather model were statistically valid for the six stations in northern New Jersey. The abcd model resulted in a simulated seasonal cycle of groundwater levels similar to fluctuations observed in nearby wells by with greater persistence. These results suggest that extreme caution should be used in attaching physical significance to model parameters and in using the state variables of the models in indices of drought and basin productivity.},

	abstract = {Data substantiating perched conditions in layered bedrock uplands are rare and have not been widely reported. Field observations in layered sedimentary bedrock in southwestern Wisconsin, {USA}, provide evidence of a stable, laterally extensive perched aquifer. Data from a densely instrumented field site show a perched aquifer in shallow dolomite, underlain by a shale-and-dolomite aquitard approximately 25 m thick, which is in turn underlain by sandstone containing a 30-m-thick unsaturated zone above a regional aquifer. Heads in water supply wells indicate that perched conditions extend at least several kilometers into hillsides, which is consistent with published modeling studies. Observations of unsaturated conditions in the sandstone over a 4-year period, historical development of the perched aquifer, and perennial flow from upland springs emanating from the shallow dolomite suggest that perched groundwater is a stable hydrogeologic feature under current climate conditions. Water-table hydrographs exhibit apparent differences in the amount and timing of recharge to the perched and regional flow systems; steep hydraulic gradients and tritium and chloride concentrations suggest there is limited hydraulic connection between the two. Recognition and characterization of perched flow systems have practical importance because their groundwater flow and transport pathways may differ significantly from those in underlying flow systems. Construction of multi-aquifer wells and groundwater withdrawal in perched systems can further alter such pathways.},

Sixteen hydrological variables were used and low-flow and entire-flow regionalizations were derived. The low-flow regionalization was spatially indistinct and therefore unusable, but the entire-flow regionalization produced five distinctive and spatially significant regions. Least-squares relationships were calculated between mean annual runoff, catchment area and coefficient of variation of annual flows, and the 16 variables. Rivers in the dry western districts of Victoria exhibit high variability of annual, monthly and peak flows, and low specific low flows. The converse is true for rivers in the western highlands of Victoria. Stream regionalizations are a useful tool for stream ecologists, and may be used for generating hypotheses, for detecting representative rivers and for producing baseline stream surveys.{\textless}/P{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {This paper presents the findings of a study aimed at decomposing a flow hydrograph into different segments based on physical concepts in a catchment, and modelling different segments using different technique viz. conceptual and artificial neural networks ({ANNs}). An integrated modelling framework is proposed capable of modelling infiltration, base flow, evapotranspiration, soil moisture accounting, and certain segments of the decomposed flow hydrograph using conceptual techniques and the complex, non-linear, and dynamic rainfall-runoff process using {ANN} technique. Specifically, five different multi-layer perceptron ({MLP}) and two self-organizing map ({SOM}) models have been developed. The rainfall and streamflow data derived from the Kentucky River catchment were employed to test the proposed methodology and develop all the models. The performance of all the models was evaluated using seven different standard statistical measures. The results obtained in this study indicate that (a) the rainfall-runoff relationship in a large catchment consists of at least three or four different mappings corresponding to different dynamics of the underlying physical processes, (b) an integrated approach that models the different segments of the decomposed flow hydrograph using different techniques is better than a single {ANN} in modelling the complex, dynamic, non-linear, and fragmented rainfall runoff process, (c) a simple model based on the concept of flow recession is better than an {ANN} to model the falling limb of a flow hydrograph, and (d) decomposing a flow hydrograph into the different segments corresponding to the different dynamics based on the physical concepts is better than using the soft decomposition employed using {SOM}.},

	abstract = {The study highlights the dangers of limiting recharge calculations in humid climates to meteorological and soil considerations. It highlights the importance of developing a conceptual understanding of the influence of geology on recharge mechanisms and recharge rates. Uncertainties in recharge estimates through tills are examined by a study of the available literature, combined with sensitivity analyses of soil moisture budget parameters and of hypothetical scenarios of till properties and hydraulic gradients that are realistic for Irish conditions. The sensitivity analyses demonstrate that till properties have a greater influence over recharge than the soil moisture budgeting parameters. Results are considered in terms of recharge coefficients, representing the proportion of effective precipitation that becomes actual recharge to the aquifer. The literature review identifies a range in recharge coefficients from 4\% to 90\% in selected field and catchment scale studies from bedrock aquifers in Ireland and the U.K. The sensitivity analyses are able to simulate a similar range in recharge coefficient of 2\% to 80\% by varying only till permeability, thickness and vertical hydraulic gradients. In the scenarios examined, the greatest sensitivity to vertical till permeability lies between 0.001 m/day and 0.01 m/day. The sensitivity to soil moisture budgeting parameters is much less apparent. It is concluded that this is due to the dominance of grassland in Ireland and the relatively wet summers, resulting in the limited development of soil moisture deficits by comparison with some parts of the U.K.},

	abstract = {Six approaches for downscaling climate model outputs for use in hydrologic simulation were evaluated, with particular emphasis on each method's ability to produce precipitation and other variables used to drive a macroscale hydrology model applied at much higher spatial resolution than the climate model. Comparisons were made on the basis of a twenty-year retrospective (1975–1995) climate simulation produced by the {NCAR}-{DOE} Parallel {ClimateModel} ({PCM}), and the implications of the comparison for a future(2040–2060) {PCM} climate scenario were also explored. The six approaches were made up of three relatively simple statistical downscaling methods – linear interpolation ({LI}), spatial disaggregation ({SD}), and bias-correction and spatial disaggregation ({BCSD}) – each applied to both {PCM} output directly(at T42 spatial resolution), and after dynamical downscaling via a Regional Climate Model ({RCM} – at 1/2-degree spatial resolution), for downscaling the climate model outputs to the 1/8-degree spatial resolution of the hydrological model. For the retrospective climate simulation, results were compared to an observed gridded climatology of temperature and precipitation, and gridded hydrologic variables resulting from forcing the hydrologic model with observations. The most significant findings are that the {BCSD} method was successful in reproducing the main features of the observed hydrometeorology from the retrospective climate simulation, when applied to both {PCM} and {RCM} outputs. Linear interpolation produced better results using {RCM} output than {PCM} output, but both methods ({PCM}-{LI} and {RCM}-{LI}) lead to unacceptably biased hydrologic simulations. Spatial disaggregation of the {PCM} output produced results similar to those achieved with the {RCM} interpolated output; nonetheless, neither {PCM} nor {RCM} output was useful for hydrologic simulation purposes without a bias-correction step. For the future climate scenario, only the {BCSD}-method (using {PCM} or {RCM}) was able to produce hydrologically plausible results. With the {BCSD} method, the {RCM}-derived hydrology was more sensitive to climate change than the {PCM}-derived hydrology.},

	volume = {37},
	abstract = {Sediment is an important pollutant for Lake Erie and its tributaries as a carrier of other substances and as a pollutant in its own right. Environmental managers have called for major reductions in sediment loadings in Lake Erie tributaries. In this study, 30-yr (1975–2005) datasets with daily resolution are analyzed to identify and interpret trends in sediment concentrations and loads in major {US} tributaries to Lake Erie. The Maumee and Sandusky Rivers in agricultural northwest Ohio show continual decreases throughout this period, but the River Raisin shows increases, especially in the last decade. The urban and forested Cuyahoga River shows little trend before 2000 but shows increases since then. The mostly forested Grand River shows strong decreases before 1995, little change thereafter until the early 2000s, and then increases. In most cases, the greatest decreases or smallest increases, depending on the river, are associated with summer and fall and with low flow conditions, whereas the smallest decreases or greatest increases are associated with the spring and with high flow conditions. Analysis of concentration–flow relationships indicates that these changes are not due to weather but reflect positive and negative anthropogenic influences. Sediment decreases in the northwestern Ohio tributaries seem to reflect the successful use of agricultural practices to reduce erosion and prevent sediment loss. Opportunities for further reductions in sediment loads and concentrations lie in better management of sediment losses during winter and spring.},

	abstract = {River water temperature is a common target of water quality models at the watershed scale, owing to its principal role in shaping biogeochemical processes and in stream ecology. Usually, models include physically-based, deterministic formulations to calculate water temperatures from detailed meteorological information, which usually comes from meteorological stations located far from the river reaches. However, alternative empirical approaches have been proposed, that usually depend on air temperature as master variable. This study explored the performance of a semidistributed water quality application modelling river water temperature in a Mediterranean watershed, using three different approaches. First, a deterministic approach was used accounting for the different heat exchange components usually considered in water temperature models. Second, an empirical approximation was applied using the equilibrium temperature concept, assuming a linear relationship with air temperature. And third, a hybrid approach was constructed, in which the temperature equilibrium concept and the deterministic approach were combined. Results showed that the hybrid approach gave the best results, followed by the empirical approximation. The deterministic formulation gave the worst results. The hybrid approach not only fitted daily river water temperatures, but also adequately modelled the daily temperature range (maximum–minimum daily temperature). Other river water features directly dependent on water temperature, such as river intrusion depth in lentic systems (i.e. the depth at which the river inflow plunges to equilibrate density differences with lake water), were also correctly modelled even at hourly time steps. However, results for the different heat fluxes between river and atmosphere were very unrealistic. Although direct evidence of discrepancies between meteorological drivers measured at the meteorological stations and the actual river microclimate was not found, the use of models including empirical or hybrid formulations depending mainly on air temperature is recommended if only meteorological data from locations far from the river reaches are available.

Vegetation is modelled as a dynamic component with the modified Gash model. The equation is solved with a modified second order Leapfrog explicit finite difference scheme with centred time and space derivatives. The model was validated with standard analytical solutions. Evaluation with results from field campaigns in the Volta Basin of West Africa during the 2002 rainfall season indicates good agreement, with r2 values ranging from 0·89 to 0·96. The developed method will be useful in studying the dynamics of surface runoff generation under complex microtopographic conditions, spatially varying soil hydraulic characteristics and temporally dynamic rainfall intensity, as found in many tropical catchments.

	abstract = {The fundamental rationale for statistical downscaling is that the raw outputs of climate change experiments from General Circulation Models ({GCMs}) are an inadequate basis for assessing the effects of climate change on land-surface processes at regional scales. This is because the spatial resolution of {GCMs} is too coarse to resolve important sub-grid scale processes (most notably those pertaining to the hydrological cycle) and because {GCM} output is often unreliable at individual and sub-grid box scales. By establishing empirical relationships between grid-box scale circulation indices (such as atmospheric vorticity and divergence) and sub-grid scale surface predictands (such as precipitation), statistical downscaling has been proposed as a practical means of bridging this spatial difference. This study compared three sets of current and future rainfall-runoff scenarios. The scenarios were constructed using: (1) statistically downscaled {GCM} output; (2) raw {GCM} output; and (3) raw {GCM} output corrected for elevational biases. Atmospheric circulation indices and humidity variables were extracted from the output of the {UK} Meteorological Office coupled ocean-atmosphere {GCM} ({HadCM}2) in order to downscale daily precipitation and temperature series for the Animas River in the San Juan River basin, Colorado. Significant differences arose between the modelled snowpack and flow regimes of the three future climate scenarios. Overall, the raw {GCM} output suggests larger reductions in winter/spring snowpack and summer runoff than the downscaling, relative to current conditions. Further research is required to determine the generality of the water resource implications for other regions, {GCM} outputs and downscaled scenarios.},

	abstract = {Summary
Regional ground-water recharge estimates for Minnesota were compared to estimates made on the basis of four local- and basin-scale methods. Three local-scale methods (unsaturated-zone water balance, water-table fluctuations ({WTF}) using three approaches, and age dating of ground water) yielded point estimates of recharge that represent spatial scales from about 1 to about 1000\&\#xa0;m2. A fourth method ({RORA}, a basin-scale analysis of streamflow records using a recession-curve-displacement technique) yielded recharge estimates at a scale of 10–1000s of km2. The {RORA} basin-scale recharge estimates were regionalized to estimate recharge for the entire State of Minnesota on the basis of a regional regression recharge ({RRR}) model that also incorporated soil and climate data. Recharge rates estimated by the {RRR} model compared favorably to the local and basin-scale recharge estimates. {RRR} estimates at study locations were about 41\% less on average than the unsaturated-zone water-balance estimates, ranged from 44\% greater to 12\% less than estimates that were based on the three {WTF} approaches, were about 4\% less than the age dating of ground-water estimates, and were about 5\% greater than the {RORA} estimates. Of the methods used in this study, the {WTF} method is the simplest and easiest to apply. Recharge estimates made on the basis of the {UZWB} method were inconsistent with the results from the other methods. Recharge estimates using the {RRR} model could be a good source of input for regional ground-water flow models; {RRR} model results currently are being applied for this purpose in {USGS} studies elsewhere.},

	abstract = {Summary
Estimating uncertainty of hydrologic forecasting is valuable to water resources and other relevant decision making processes. Recently, Bayesian Neural Networks ({BNNs}) have been proved powerful tools for quantifying uncertainty of streamflow forecasting. In this study, we propose a Markov Chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) framework ({BNN}-{PIS}) to incorporate the uncertainties associated with parameters, inputs, and structures into {BNNs}. This framework allows the structure of the neural networks to change by removing or adding connections between neurons and enables scaling of input data by using rainfall multipliers. The results show that the new {BNNs} outperform {BNNs} that only consider uncertainties associated with parameters and model structures. Critical evaluation of posterior distribution of neural network weights, number of effective connections, rainfall multipliers, and hyper-parameters shows that the assumptions held in our {BNNs} are not well supported. Further understanding of characteristics of and interactions among different uncertainty sources is expected to enhance the application of neural networks for uncertainty analysis of hydrologic forecasting.},

Conventional methods for quantifying parameter uncertainty are difficult to apply to {ANN} weights because of the complexity of these models, and complicated methods developed for this purpose have been not been adopted by water resources practitioners because of the difficulty in implementing them. This paper presents a relatively straightforward Bayesian training method that enables weight uncertainty to be accounted for in {ANN} predictions. The method is applied to a salinity forecasting case study, and the resulting {ANN} is shown to significantly outperform an {ANN} developed using standard approaches in a real-time forecasting scenario. Moreover, the Bayesian approach produces prediction limits that indicate the level of uncertainty in the predictions, which is extremely important if forecasts are to be used with confidence in water resources applications.},

As flow models become increasingly utilized for management decisions, there is an increased need for simple, practical methods to delineate recharge zones and quantify recharge rates. Existing models for estimating recharge distributions are data intensive, require extensive parameterization, and take a significant investment of time in order to establish. The Wisconsin Geological and Natural History Survey ({WGNHS}) has developed a simple daily soil–water balance ({SWB}) model that uses readily available soil, land cover, topographic, and climatic data in conjunction with a geographic information system ({GIS}) to estimate the temporal and spatial distribution of groundwater recharge at the watershed scale for temperate humid areas. To demonstrate the methodology and the applicability and performance of the model, two case studies are presented: one for the forested Trout Lake watershed of north central Wisconsin, {USA} and the other for the urban-agricultural Pheasant Branch Creek watershed of south central Wisconsin, {USA}. Overall, the {SWB} model performs well and presents modelers and planners with a practical tool for providing recharge estimates for modeling and water resource planning purposes in humid areas.},

Catchments smaller than 250 ha normally have no perennial streams but may have many springs that flow for short distances and then reenter the ground. Land use has been shown to influence the surface hydrology greatly. Tilled cropland is the principal source of flood runoff and stream sediment. Runoff from forest land is minimal regardless of its slope or condition. The occurrence and movement of groundwater are complex, perched water bodies and dry pockets being intermixed with water tables that rise and fall in rapid response to rainfall and snowmelt and in close synchronization with spring flow. Snowmelt produces a distinctive diurnal pattern of both overland flow and groundwater rise, sometimes in midwinter. Overland flow usually peaks about midafternoon and diminishes to near zero a few hours later. The groundwater peak comes early in the morning of the next day. We found little difference in the daily timing of overland flow from north- and south-facing catchments once the melt period had begun. Larger catchments responded to both rainfall and snowmelt much the same as smaller experimental catchments.},

The predictive model developed here attempts to use a water balance approach that extracts information from the masses of catchment-scale time series data available on precipitation, energy-related variables and stream discharge. It begins with a few simple assumptions in order to seek some synthesis of the climate and landscape controls on evapotranspiration and soil moisture feedbacks, and catchment water yields. The model adopts the hydrograph identification approach used in the linear module of the rainfall-runoff model {IHACRES} but replaces the previous statistically based non-linear evapotranspiration loss module by a catchment moisture deficit accounting scheme. One advantage of this more conceptual approach is that evapotranspiration can be output on the same time step at which precipitation and energy variables are available (such as from {GCMs}), and this time step can be shorter (e.g. half hourly) than the discharge time step (e.g. daily) used to calibrate the model parameters.},

	abstract = {Carbonate-sandstone geology in southeastern Minnesota creates a heterogeneous landscape of springs, seeps, and sinkholes that supply groundwater into streams. Air temperatures are effective predictors of water temperature in surface-water dominated streams. However, no published work investigates the relationship between air and water temperatures in groundwater-fed streams ({GWFS}) across watersheds. We used simple linear regressions to examine weekly air-water temperature relationships for 40 {GWFS} in southeastern Minnesota. A 40-stream, composite linear regression model has a slope of 0.38, an intercept of 6.63, and R2 of 0.83. The regression models for {GWFS} have lower slopes and higher intercepts in comparison to surface-water dominated streams. Regression models for streams with high R2 values offer promise for use as predictive tools for future climate conditions. Climate change is expected to alter the thermal regime of groundwater-fed systems, but will do so at a slower rate than surface-water dominated systems. A regression model of intercept vs. slope can be used to identify streams for which water temperatures are more meteorologically than groundwater controlled, and thus more vulnerable to climate change. Such relationships can be used to guide restoration vs. management strategies to protect trout streams.},

	abstract = {Efficient numerical simulation of process interactions between infiltration and Hortonian runoff is needed to evaluate patterns of internal state variables and fluxes within a watershed. A fully distributed rainfall–runoff model was developed for event-based studies of space–time watershed processes. A routing hierarchy was defined over the watershed using the D-infinity contributing area algorithm. Computation of ponding time was included to handle variable run-on and rainfall intensity. The Green–Ampt model was adopted to calculate surface infiltration, and the kinematic wave model was used to route Hortonian runoff and channel flow. The model can handle input rainfall, soil parameters, and other properties that vary in space and time. The model was tested first against analytical solutions for idealized overland planes. After a sensitivity analysis to identify the most significant parameters, it was then calibrated and verified using rainfall and streamflow data from the {USDA}-{ARS} Walnut Gulch experimental watershed in Arizona, {USA}. The coefficients of efficiency for runoff volume, peak flow, and time to peak flow with respect to calibration/validation are 0.95/0.65, 0.85/0.09, and 0.69/0.88, respectively. Example applications of the model show its potential for simulating internal states and fluxes. The open-source model is provided for space–time simulation and scaling of event-based Hortonian runoff and infiltration.},

Comparisons of computed and measured stream flow in 28 basins on the Delmarva peninsula show that for some basins the agreement is excellent (regression line essentially equals unity), for other basins the regression line has a slope of one but it is displaced above or below the y=x line, while for other basins, the slope of the regression line differs appreciably from unity. Study of the basins where agreement between computed and measured values is only fair to poor reveals that the patterns of disagreement can be used to provide information on the water holding capacity in the root zone of the soil, on the quantity of deep aquifer recharge within the basin, or on the effect of human modifications within the basin. The technique should also reveal the quantity of interbasin transfers or other consumptive uses within the basin. The water budget, thus, becomes a useful tool to study hydrologic characteristics or their changes over time within a basin.},

	abstract = {Most conceptual models of catchment hydrology include algorithms for estimation of recharge to groundwater, which is then routed to stream base flow and/or deep regional groundwater. The majority of models attempt to simulate the process of percolation to groundwater from an overlying soil water store, which may be conceived as a single store or a series combination of stores. However, these models have seldom been tested against field observations, and therefore, the purpose of this study is to compare the performance of 13 single store and two-store models, selected from the literature, using an 11 years daily record from a weighing lysimeter 2.4\&\#xa0;m deep at Coshocton, {OH}, supporting a pasture grass. The percolation data are measured directly, while the volume of water in the soil column is measured by weighing the monolith every 5\&\#xa0;min. Use of data from three adjacent non-weighing lysimeters enabled an assessment of the spatial variability of groundwater recharge. The results of the study show that five models perform well in simulating recharge to a level consistent with spatial variability over a scale of a few metres, but did not perform as well in simulating variations of total soil water in the column, particularly during periods of high evapotranspiration. All the models, however, tend to underestimate the sharp peaks in recharge which may occur in extreme events.},

Agreement between the calibrated {FAO}‐{BC} method and lysimeters was excellent for daily, weekly and monthly estimates when measured values for solar radiation, air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed were used. An elevation correction reduced scatter in estimates among Idaho locations. Statistics describing the daily Penman and {FAO}‐{BC} estimates deviated from those calculated for measured alfalfa reference evapotranspiration. Air temperature and relative humidity data for nonagricultural weather stations were adjusted according to fetch and aridity before being used to estimate consumptive use requirements throughout Idaho. Calibration of the {FAO}‐{BC} allowed use of alfalfa‐based crop coefficients.},

	abstract = {Arctic amplification ({AA}) – the observed enhanced warming in high northern latitudes relative to the northern hemisphere – is evident in lower-tropospheric temperatures and in 1000-to-500 {hPa} thicknesses. Daily fields of 500 {hPa} heights from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Reanalysis are analyzed over N. America and the N. Atlantic to assess changes in north-south (Rossby) wave characteristics associated with {AA} and the relaxation of poleward thickness gradients. Two effects are identified that each contribute to a slower eastward progression of Rossby waves in the upper-level flow: 1) weakened zonal winds, and 2) increased wave amplitude. These effects are particularly evident in autumn and winter consistent with sea-ice loss, but are also apparent in summer, possibly related to earlier snow melt on high-latitude land. Slower progression of upper-level waves would cause associated weather patterns in mid-latitudes to be more persistent, which may lead to an increased probability of extreme weather events that result from prolonged conditions, such as drought, flooding, cold spells, and heat waves.},

	abstract = {The Beaverkill Watershed in the Catskill Mountains of New York, U.S.A., shows evidence of high summer stream temperatures throughout critical trout habitat. Because habitat quality, as characterized by stream temperature, dramatically influences trout communities, it is important for biologists to identify and map these characteristics and to monitor how they change over time. Stream temperatures were recorded over time throughout the Beaverkill Watershed and were used to identify thermal refugia and areas of thermal stress. Seventy-two temperature loggers were placed throughout the watershed during the summer of 2000. Three geostatistical metrics for predicting temperature across the watershed were constructed and evaluated. The first metric utilized the shortest path between temperature loggers without using stream network information. A second metric used distances calculated along the stream network in both upstream and downstream directions. Our final metric was a modified network system in which the distances were weighted by stream order. Each metric was found to provide predictive capability, with added complexity improving the accuracy of represented stream temperatures.Dans le système hydrographique de Beaverkill dans les monts Catskill du New York, E.-U., il y a des indices de températures élevées en été dans tout l'habitat critique de la truite. Parce que la qualité de l'habitat, telle que définie par la température de l'eau, influence fortement les communautés de truites, il est important que les biologistes identifient et cartographient ces températures et suivent leur évolution dans le temps. La température a été enregistrée dans tout le réseau hydrographique de Beaverkill à l'aide de 72 thermomètres enregistreurs à l'été 2000, ce qui a permis d'identifier les refuges et les points de stress thermique. Trois métriques géostatistiques ont été mises au point et évaluées pour prédire la température dans l'ensemble du réseau. La première métrique est la distance minimale entre deux enregistreurs sans tenir compte de renseignements provenant du réseau hydrographique. La seconde métrique utilise les distances calculées le long du réseau, tant vers l'amont que vers l'aval. La dernière métrique est un système de réseau modifié dans lequel les distances sont pondérées en fonction de l'ordre du cours d'eau. Chaque métrique possède un pouvoir de prédiction particulier et la complexité croissante des métriques améliore la justesse de leurs représentations des températures des cours d'eau.[Traduit par la Rédaction]},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}:  One of the biggest challenges in managing cold water streams in the Midwest is understanding how stream temperature is controlled by the complex interactions among meteorologic processes, channel geometry, and ground water inflow. Inflow of cold ground water, shade provided by riparian vegetation, and channel width are the most important factors controlling summer stream temperatures. A simple screening model was used to quantitatively evaluate the importance of these factors and guide management decisions. The model uses an analytical solution to the heat transport equation to predict steady-state temperature throughout a stream reach. The model matches field data from four streams in southwestern Wisconsin quite well (typically within 1°C) and helps explain the observed warming and cooling trends along each stream reach. The distribution of ground water inflow throughout a stream reach has an important influence on stream temperature, and springs are especially effective at providing thermal refuge for fish. Although simple, this model provides insight into the importance of ground water and the impact different management strategies, such as planting trees to increase shade, may have on summer stream temperature.},

	shorttitle = {Reducing Predictive Uncertainty in {HSPF} Watershed Model Applications},
	abstract = {{WinHSPF} is the interface to the {HSPF} lumped parameter watershed model in the {EPA} {BASINS} modeling system. {WinHSPF} includes a driver for the Parameter Estimation ({PEST}) program. {PEST} calibrates models by minimizing an “objective function” quantifying the misfit between model outputs and corresponding field measurements. Where flow gage, precipitation, and other model data are error free, the model structure perfectly represents actual watersheds, and model parameters are not redundant, minimizing an objective function should result in a single unique input parameter set and highly certain model predictions. In the real world, errors in model input, calibration data, and model structure result in equivalent measures of goodness of fit for wholly distinct input parameter sets. {PEST}, run in predictive mode, identifies those input parameter sets that maximize and minimize a given prediction while satisfying the condition that the model satisfactorily fits historical data. This range of uncertainty in model prediction results from parameter non-uniqueness, and from data and model errors.

The impact of model input and calibration data errors on predictive uncertainty is examined. First, the ability of {PEST} to identify correct input parameter sets under ideal conditions is tested. {PEST} is used to calibrate {HSPF} against a pseudo “observed” time series, i.e. output from a pre-calibrated {HSPF} model. {PEST} is then run in predictive mode to identify minimum and maximum predictions of surface runoff rate. Artificial measurement errors are then imposed on the flow gage and precipitation time series, and other key model inputs. For each alteration of the model input or calibration time series, {PEST} is run in predictive mode to identify the effect on predictive uncertainty. The effects from the following error types are examined: precipitation time series errors including altered storm volumes, overall percent change in precipitation, and a random error function; streamflow gage errors including systematic bias and a random error function; non-representative precipitation and other meteorological gage data (switched with another nearby gage); incorrect fixed input parameters such as stage/discharge relationship and overland flow plane variables; and incorrect parameter range limits.

Methods of insulating model applications from these potential errors are examined. Specifically, the protective effect of different objective function component types against certain error types is demonstrated. Objective function components included in the study are simulated versus measured daily streamflow, cumulative seasonal flow volumes, flow exceedence curves, and other corrective measures. Specific objective function components, found effective in protecting against common errors in model input and/or calibration time series, are identified.},

The model used includes physical process like infiltration from rainfall or irrigation, redistribution in soil water zone, plant water uptake in the form of actual evapotranspiration and percolation out of the soil reservoir. In addition, the model considers dynamics of crop root growth model that affect the plant water uptake and hence the soil water in the unsaturated zone. The model satisfactorily simulates the soil water content in the active root zone of the crop on daily basis. Values of the mean absolute relative error ({MARE}) index between the observed and simulated soil water content of the rain-fed mustard in 1998 and 1999 are found to be 0.046 and 0.058, respectively, whereas for irrigated mustard, it is 0.051 in 1999. Prediction efficiency ({PE}) index is found to be 0.98, 0.97 and 0.97 for rain-fed mustard of 1998 and 1999 and irrigated mustard of 1999, respectively. Since the {MARE} index is low and {PE} index is high for both rain-fed and irrigated mustard, the model can be used to simulate the soil water content in the active root zone of the crop.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a one-dimensional stream temperature model that is computationally efficient and highly scalable in both time and space. The model is developed within the framework of state space structure. The time-dependent equations for the conservation of thermal energy in a flowing stream or river are solved using a mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian, or semi-Lagrangian, numerical scheme. Solutions are obtained by tracking individual water parcels along their flow characteristics and storing the simulated results at discrete points on a fixed grid. Computational efficiency and accuracy of the numerical scheme are demonstrated by comparison of model estimates with observations of stream temperatures from rivers in the Pacific Northwest as well as with results from a closed-form solution of the energy equation. A preliminary analysis of the impact of climate changes on stream temperature in the Columbia River system illustrates the strengths of the semi-Lagrangian method for addressing water quality issues of regional, national, and, ultimately, global scale. Further development of the semi-Lagrangian method has the potential to improve the ability of water quality planners to perform uncertainty analysis, risk analysis, and forecasting for large, complex river systems.},

Since adequate pollutant concentration data are lacking for many river systems, but flow data are often available, measures of flow variability may be the only source of information for planning monitoring programs or evaluating the behavior of tributaries on a basin-wide scale. Seven measures of flow variability were developed, and their characteristics were examined using flow data from Great Lakes tributaries. Classification of the tributaries based on flow variability were compared with an event-responsiveness classification of earlier investigators. Lack of agreement is conspicuous, and can be attributed in part to an inadequate chemical data base for many rivers when the earlier classification was established. Cluster analysis was used to reveal the natural groupings of 118 U.S. and Canadian Great Lakes tributaries, based on measures of flow variability. The resulting classification of the tributaries is geographically coherent, and demonstrates that large areas of high flow variability are found in the western and central Lake Erie drainage basin, probably as a result of intense agricultural land use in association with heavy soils. Tributaries draining urban areas also tend to have high flow variability. Most of the tributaries which drain the northern Great Lakes watershed have low flow variability. (Author 's abstract)},

We have implemented a secant version of the Levenberg–Marquardt ({LM}) method that requires far fewer model calls for local search than the {PEST} {LM} methodology. Efficiency studies on three distinct environmental model structures ({HSPF}, {FASST}, and {GSSHA}) show that we can find comparable local minima with 36–84\% fewer model calls than a conventional model independent {LM} application. Using the secant {LM} method for local search, {MICUT} also supports global optimization through the use of a slightly modified version of a stochastic global search technique called Multi-Level Single Linkage [Rinnooy Kan, A.H.G., Timmer, G., 1987a. Stochastic global optimization methods, part I: clustering methods. Math. Program. 39, 27–56; Rinnooy Kan, A.H.G., Timmer, G., 1987b. Stochastic global optimization methods, part ii: multi level methods. Math. Program. 39, 57–78.].

The combination and comparison of conceptually different methods has been recommended as a strategy for evaluating recharge estimates. In this article, recharge estimates from water-table fluctuation ({WTF}) methods are combined with and compared to the results of the spatially and temporally discretized soil-water-balance model {PROMET} (processes of radiation, mass and energy transfer). As {PROMET} and {WTF} methods rely on different measurable variables, a comparison of these two contrasting techniques allows improved assessment of the plausibility of recharge estimates. An enhanced approach to {WTF} methods is presented. The approach assumes that in the case of no recharge, there exists a maximum possible potential decline for any given groundwater level. The primary conclusion is that {WTF} methods are excellent for determining the plausibility of spatially distributed regional-groundwater-recharge estimation approaches and for detecting inconsistencies in available models. Recharge estimates derived from {WTF} approaches alone are, however, not suitable for regional-scale recharge estimation due to (1) their strong dependency on local data, applicability of which is limited to only very specific conditions, and (2) their sensitivity to influences other than recharge.},

	title = {The spatial and temporal variability of groundwater recharge within the Trout Lake basin of northern Wisconsin},
	abstract = {Recharge is one of the most difficult, complex, uncertain, and important hydrologic parameters to quantify in the evaluation of groundwater resources. Consequently, quantifying recharge, and its temporal and spatial variability, is one of the leading problems in hydrologic research and is important for groundwater resource evaluation, water quality protection, streamflow management, groundwater flow modeling, and contaminant transport. Four different field-based methods, which utilize soil moisture, water level, streamflow, and baseflow data, and three modeling approaches (an analytic element model, a terrestrial biosphere model, and a soil water balance model) were used to assess the spatial and temporal distribution of natural recharge in the Trout Lake basin of northern Wisconsin for 1996-2000. The results of the different techniques exhibited similar recharge values and distributions, although each approach had its strengths, weaknesses, and limitations. The purpose of the analysis, the type of data available, and the required space and time scales should dictate the recharge method selected. The field measurements and model simulations showed that recharge varies both spatially and temporally within the basin, enough to have implications for water resource management and ecological analyses. Temporal recharge variability is governed by the amount, timing, and type of precipitation, the soil moisture, the thickness of the unsaturated zone, the sediment type, and the land cover. For the five years assessed (1996-2000), monthly recharge rates varied from 0 to 21.3 cm/month, and annual recharge estimates varied almost three-fold. Intra-annually, recharge was limited in the basin to a few isolated events each year and exhibited a distinct seasonal pattern, with the spring snowmelt event constituting the single largest recharge event each year and minor recharge associated with spring and/or late fall rains. Recharge also varied spatially, by as much as 18 cm per year. Spatial recharge variability is due to variability in land cover, soil type, topography, and climate. Vegetation was shown to be the strongest control on the spatial recharge distribution in this basin.* *This dissertation is compound (contains both a paper copy and {CD} as part of the dissertation).

Deleterious effects of the wind and wetting losses on the interior walls of the gage were considered. These "corrected" estimates were obtained using site-specific information including wind speed, shelter-height air temperature, gage height, and sheltering. Wind speed and air temperature were interpolated at stations for which these data were not available using a spherically-based, nearest neighbor interpolation procedure. Results indicate that, as expected, biases are greater in the winter than the summer owing to the increased problems (particularly wind-induced) of measuring snowfall. In summer, percent errors range between 4 and 6 percent over nearly three-quarters of the United States with slightly larger errors over the Rocky Mountains. By contrast, winter biases are highly correlated with snowfall totals and percentage errors increase poleward, mimicking patterns of snowfall frequency. Since these biases are not trivial, they must be accounted for in order to obtain accurate and reliable time-series. If these biases are not properly addressed, serious errors can be introduced into climate change, hydrologic modeling, and environmental impact research.},

Shepard's method for constructing global interpolants by blending local interpolants using locally-supported weight functions usually creates reasonable approximations. This paper describes {SHEPPACK}, a Fortran 95 package containing five versions of the modified Shepard algorithm. These five versions include quadratic ({TOMS} Algorithm 660, 661, and 798), cubic ({TOMS} Algorithm 790), and linear variations of the original Shepard algorithm. The main goal of {SHEPPACK} is to provide users with a single consistent package consisting of all existing polynomial variations of Shepard's algorithm. The algorithms target data of different dimensions. The linear Shepard algorithm is the only algorithm in the package that is applicable to arbitrary dimensional data. The motivation is to enable researchers to experiment with different algorithms using their data and select one (or more) that is best suited to their needs, and to support interpolation for sparse, high dimensional data sets.},

	abstract = {In the southeastern Holstein region, located to the east of the metropolitan zone of Hamburg, northern Germany, a groundwater investigation program was conducted from 1984 to 2000 by the State Agency for Nature and Environment (Landesamt für Natur und Umwelt, {LANU}) of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, with the aim of providing long-term, ecologically acceptable groundwater management plans for the region. The focal point of the investigation comprised the determination of groundwater recharge rates. The investigation method was based on the transfer of available lysimeter results from other regions to comparable regions within the area studied. With the help of lysimeter equations, potential amounts of percolation water were calculated. The groundwater recharge rate was then determined after subtraction of the surface runoff which was calculated for the entire area. All computations were performed with a spreadsheet program. Groundwater recharge rates were calculated for two areas. One consisted of roughly determining groundwater recharge rates for the total region (1,392 km 2 ) of southeastern Holstein. The overall goal of these investigations was to identify potential areas of water exploitation. Areas in which groundwater recharge rates are high and groundwater outflow is low are particularly suited to water exploitation, since inflow rates into deeper aquifers are high. These areas are located on the flanks of the Elbe and Stecknitz River valleys. Subsurface groundwater runoff to these lowlands would be reduced through groundwater withdrawal. However, the resulting decline in shallow groundwater tables would be so small that it would have no detrimental ecological effects. Groundwater recharge rates were also calculated for a 110-km 2 area in the outskirts of Hamburg (Grosshansdorf model area) which is intensively developed for water supply. These investigations showed that the amount of groundwater recharge is already being withdrawn to a large extent. Approximately 65\% of the recharge rate is currently withdrawn by the waterworks in this area, thus making further increases in exploitation rates unjustifiable from an ecological point of view.},

Approximately 8 percent of the data sets calculated {AET} in error. Errors were detected in months when estimated {AET} was greater than potential evapotranspiration. Annual climate variability led to errors in accrued soil water storage, which led to errors in the calculation of {AET}. Two hydrologically justifiable modifications were made to correct errors resulting from the use of the original coded Thornthwaite model. The first modification allows for soil water accumulation throughout the year, whereas the second allows for oversaturated soil conditions in the spring. The modified program appears to be robust for any temperate climate condition.},

	abstract = {The accuracy of runoff curve numbers ({CNs}) is unknown, and empirical evidence has suggested that with the current {CN} table, hydrological systems are being over designed—which some believe is due to a variable known as the initial abstraction coefficient (lambda). Therefore, guidelines to produce a new {CN} table are needed. In order to develop this set of guidelines, the following objectives were met: Determination of {CN} and lambda sensitivity, assessment of the accuracy of alternative methods for determining {CNs}, examination of the effect of the range of data, and evaluation of the potential change in hydrologic design due to a new table. Using measured and simulated data, the methods of estimating the {CN} were evaluated and assessed for accuracy. A new method using concepts of lognormal frequency was developed and found to be more accurate than the current practices. It was also found that lambda is an insensitive variable when compared to the {CN}, and therefore, may complicate the optimal fitting of the {CNs}. Finally, it was determined that developing a new {CN} table would affect the estimation of peak discharge rates, and thus hydrologic designs. Therefore, it may be advantageous to develop a new {CN} table based on peak discharge measurements rather than depths of rainfall and runoff. Guidelines that should lead to a revised {CN} model with improved accuracy are provided.},

model is applied to the Little Washita watershed in Central Oklahoma, {USA} and compared
to runoff, soil moisture and energy flux observations. The connection between
groundwater dynamics and the land surface energy balance is studied using a variety of
conventional and spatial statistical measures. For a number of energy variables a strong
interconnection is demonstrated with water table depth. This connection varies seasonally
and spatially depending on the spatial composition of water table depth. A theoretical
critical water table depth range is presented where a strong sensitivity between
groundwater and land-surface processes may be observed. For this particular watershed, a
critical depth range is established between 1 and 5 m in which the land surface energy
budget is most sensitive to groundwater storage. Finally, concrete recommendations are
put forth to characterize this interconnection in the field.},

With this budget, using minimal daily-weather input data and the soil-plant-water system-analysis methodology, we were able to characterize the spatial distribution of the hydrologic components of the water balance within the basin. A combination of classification and meteorological methods resulted in a basinwide integration methodology. Using this methodology, we found that, in addition to obvious climatic controls, soil, vegetation, and land-use factors also exert considerable influence on the water balance of the area. The available-water capacity ({AWC}) of soil profiles plays a dominant role in soil-water-deficit development and deep drainage. Vegetation and dryland or irrigated farming particularly affect the evapotranspiration ({ET}) components, with {ET} from irrigated corn and alfalfa being two to three times that from wheat. Deep drainage from irrigated wheat fields was found to be significantly higher than that from grassland and dryland wheat; deep drainage from alfalfa is practically nonexistent. We demonstrated how vegetation changes may affect components of the hydrologic cycle. We also showed that different portions of the watershed have different water-balance components and that use of single average values of hydrologic variables in management practices may not be realistic.},

The predictive capability of the model was improved, particularly for the subsoiling tillage case. The simulation results show that temporal changes in soil hydraulic conductivity induced by different tillage practices can affect percolation, water storage, transpiration and evaporation. Differences in the simulated components of the water balance were found to be small between {CT} and {NT} practices, but larger in the {ST} case. Compared with the conventional and no-tillage methods, subsoiling promotes infiltration and deep percolation, thereby favoring a possible recharge of the groundwater. Actual evaporation is always lower in the subsoiled plots, whatever the hydrological year. Transpiration is similar for the three treatments, suggesting no significant differences in water availability, except in wet years where it is higher in subsoiled soils.},

Of the seven evapotranspiration models evaluated, three models calculate actual evapotranspiration directly using the complementary relationship approach, i.e. the {CRAE} model of Morton, the advection-aridity ({AA}) model of Brutsaert and Stricker, and the {GG} model of Granger and Gray, and four models calculate first potential evapotranspiration and then actual evapotranspiration by considering the soil moisture condition. Two of the four potential evapotranspiration models belong to the temperature-based category, i.e. the Thornthwaite model and the Hargreaves model, and the other two belong to the radiation-based category, i.e. the Makkink model and the Priestley-Taylor model. The evapotranspiration calculated by the above seven models, together with precipitation, is used in the water balance model to calculate other water balance components. The results show that, for the calculation of actual evapotranspiration, the {GG} model and the Makkink model performed better than the other models; for the calculation of groundwater recharge using the water balance approach, the {GG} model and the {AA} models performed better; for the simulation of soil moisture content using the water balance approach, four models ({GG}, Thornthwaite, Makkink and Priestley-Taylor) out of the seven give equally good results. It can be concluded that the lysimeter-measured water balance components, i.e. actual evapotranspiration, groundwater recharge, soil moisture, etc., can be predicted by the {GG} model and the Makkink model with good accuracy.},

	abstract = {Successful applications of stochastic models for simulating and predicting daily stream temperature have been reported in the literature. These stochastic models have been generally tested on small rivers and have used only air temperature as an exogenous variable. This study investigates the stochastic modelling of daily mean stream water temperatures on the Moisie River, a relatively large unregulated river located in Québec, Canada. The objective of the study is to compare different stochastic approaches previously used on small streams to relate mean daily water temperatures to air temperatures and streamflow indices. Various stochastic approaches are used to model the water temperature residuals, representing short-term variations, which were obtained by subtracting the seasonal components from water temperature time-series. The first three models, a multiple regression, a second-order autoregressive model, and a Box and Jenkins model, used only lagged air temperature residuals as exogenous variables. The root-mean-square error ({RMSE}) for these models varied between 0·53 and 1·70 °C and the second-order autoregressive model provided the best results.A statistical methodology using best subsets regression is proposed to model the combined effect of discharge and air temperature on stream temperatures. Various streamflow indices were considered as additional independent variables, and models with different number of variables were tested. The results indicated that the best model included relative change in flow as the most important streamflow index. The {RMSE} for this model was of the order of 0·51 °C, which shows a small improvement over the first three models that did not include streamflow indices. The ridge regression was applied to this model to alleviate the potential statistical inadequacies associated with multicollinearity. The amplitude and sign of the ridge regression coefficients seem to be more in agreement with prior expectations (e.g. positive correlation between water temperature residuals of different lags) and make more physical sense.

Stream temperatures measured from 23 July to 3 September 1997 were used to calibrate the model, evaluate existing temperatures, generate simulations for different shade conditions and channel morphologies, and generate simulations for “average” and “warm” summers (we define a warm summer as one that is 2.8°C above the 30-year mean). The simulations indicated that successional buffers (grasses and forbs) provided as much shade as wooded buffers in streams with a width less than 2.5 m. With a low width:depth ratio, the successional buffer vegetation mediated mean temperature as well as the wooded buffer when discharge was held constant. At a discharge characteristic of our study reach, the mean temperature would be about the same along a successional buffer as in a wooded buffer if the wooded vegetation also led to widening of the stream channel. However, wooded buffers had a significantly higher percentage of shade than grazed or successional buffers. In general, temperatures in an average year decreased along the wooded reaches and increased slightly along the successional and grazed buffer areas. The differences in measured weekly mean maximum temperatures may be as great as 2.5°C across riparian buffer types. Maximum temperatures across all riparian types would be higher during warmer than average years, even with 50\% shade along the stream. Shade provided by successional and woody vegetation may serve to moderate maximum temperatures and may be sufficient for the reintroduction of brook trout if other conditions improve.},

	abstract = {Abstract Two single‐layer models of soil water balance were tested against fortnightly neutron probe field measurements of soil water at four North Island sites. The first model assumed constant evapotranspiration from field capacity to wilting point (the “Veihmeyer” approach), whereas the second model simulated a “two‐phase” accounting of the soil moisture balance‐potential evapotranspiration above a critical water deficit and declining evapotranspiration below this deficit. The Veihmeyer model was found to be the better choice for modelling soil water in layers of 0–50 and 0–70 cm, corresponding to the zone of most pasture root activity, but the two‐phase approach had advantages when modelling the full depth of sampled soil profile (about 120 cm). The available water capacities used in the models were derived from the neutron probe measurements. Soil moisture profiles were measured fortnightly from September 1986 to September 1988. Regression of predicted moisture deficit against measured deficit explained between 88 and 97\% of the variance in most model runs for three of the four sites, with soil moisture deficit errors typically in the range of 10–20 mm. Overall, at these sites the accuracy figures for the two‐phase model runs were similar to those for the Veihmeyer model runs. The fourth soil profile was disturbed and therefore atypical. In general, there was little advantage to be gained in using daily evapotranspiration data over monthly mean evapotranspiration data. Results from this study suggest that for modelling pasture soil moisture on time scales of 2 weeks or more, the simpler Veihmeyer model is as good as the two‐phase model and can be applied with confidence to many pastoral agricultural applications such as irrigation planning and drought assessments.},

	abstract = {Environmental and societal factors such as air quality, water quality and availability, land use changes and expanding urbanization are already affecting human health and welfare, agriculture, and natural ecosystems in the Midwestern United States. Over this century, these existing stresses will likely be exacerbated by climate changes resulting from human activities. It is essential that policy decisions aimed at preserving the well-being of a region be informed by a good understanding of the region's climate, how climate might change,and the uncertainties inherent in future projections. Recent updates in climate modeling expertise and an expanded view of possible non-intervention emission scenarios have narrowed the range of change that can be expected over the Midwest throughout the next century in some ways, while broadening it in others. In contrast to previous studies, which generally consider a mid-range scenario for future emissions, this study presents the range of change that would result from low to high scenarios for climate change. In this way we account for uncertainties in anthropogenic forcing on climate change in the region and quantify the potential effects of human actions on future climate. This analysis also combines the latest climate model projections with historical records of observed climate over the past century, effectively placing potential changes in extreme event frequencies such as heavy rainfall events and temperature threshold exceedances within the context of observed variability over the past century.The purpose of this study is to provide an updated picture of the potential impacts of climate change on the Midwest to inform the impact assessment and policy development community. From the magnitude of the changes projected by this study, it is clear that these must be included in future policy decisions in order to ensure the successful adaptation and survival of existing human and natural systems in the Midwest.},

	abstract = {Recharge varies spatially and temporally as it depends on a wide variety of factors (e.g. vegetation, precipitation, climate, topography, geology, and soil type), making it one of the most difficult, complex, and uncertain hydrologic parameters to quantify. Despite its inherent variability, groundwater modellers, planners, and policy makers often ignore recharge variability and assume a single average recharge value for an entire watershed. Relatively few attempts have been made to quantify or incorporate spatial and temporal recharge variability into water resource planning or groundwater modelling efforts. In this study, a simple, daily soil-water balance model was developed and used to estimate the spatial and temporal distribution of groundwater recharge of the Trout Lake basin of northern Wisconsin for 1996-2000 as a means to quantify recharge variability. For the 5 years of study, annual recharge varied spatially by as much as 18 cm across the basin; vegetation was the predominant control on this variability. Recharge also varied temporally with a threefold annual difference over the 5-year period. Intra-annually, recharge was limited to a few isolated events each year and exhibited a distinct seasonal pattern. The results suggest that ignoring recharge variability may not only be inappropriate, but also, depending on the application, may invalidate model results and predictions for regional and local water budget calculations, water resource management, nutrient cycling, and contaminant transport studies. Recharge is spatially and temporally variable, and should be modelled as such. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Nonetheless, widespread access to predictions of subsurface contributions to rivers, lakes, and wetlands at a scale useful to environmental managers is generally lacking. In this paper, we describe a “neighborhood analysis” approach for estimating topographic constraints on spatial patterns of recharge and discharge and discuss how this index has proven useful in research, management, and conservation contexts. The Michigan Rivers Inventory subsurface flux model ({MRI}-{DARCY}) used digital elevation and hydraulic conductivity inferred from mapped surficial geology to estimate spatial patterns of hydraulic potential. Model predictions were calculated in units of specific discharge (meters per day) for a 30-m 2 -cell raster map and interpreted as an index of potential subsurface water flux (shallow groundwater and event through-flow). The model was evaluated by comparison with measurements of groundwater-related attributes at watershed, stream segment, and local spatial scales throughout Lower Michigan ({USA}). Map-based predictions using {MRI}-{DARCY} accounted for 85\% of the observed variation in base flow from 128 {USGS} gauges, 69\% of the observed variation in discharge accrual from 48 river segments, and 29\% of the residual variation in local groundwater flux from 33 locations as measured by hyporheic temperature profiles after factoring out the effects of climate. Although it does not incorporate any information about the actual water table surface, by quantifying spatial variation of key constraints on groundwater-related attributes, the model provides strata for more intensive study, as well as a useful spatial tool for regional and local conservation planning, fisheries management, wetland characterization, and stream assessment.},

The study uses a one-dimensional stream temperature model calibrated with the longitudinal profiles of stream temperature created from the four thermal imaging flights and validated with three days of continuous stream temperature data from instream data loggers on the days surrounding the thermal remote-sensing campaign. Model simulations were used to quantify the sensitivity of stream thermal habitat to increases in air and groundwater temperature and changes in base flow. The simulations indicate that stream temperatures may reach critical maximum thresholds for brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) mortality, particularly if both air temperature increases and base flow declines. The approach demonstrates that thermal infrared data can greatly assist stream temperature model validation due to its high spatial resolution, and that this spatially continuous stream temperature data can be used to pinpoint spatial heterogeneity in groundwater inflow to streams. With this spatially distributed data on thermal heterogeneity and base-flow accretion, stream temperature models considering various climate change scenarios are able to identify thermal refugia that will be critical for fisheries management under a changing climate.},

	abstract = {Rapidly depleting unconfined aquifers are the primary source of water for irrigation on the North China Plain. Yet, despite its critical importance, groundwater recharge to the Plain remains an enigma. We introduce a one-dimensional soil-water-balance model to estimate precipitation- and irrigation-generated areal recharge from commonly available crop and soil characteristics and climate data. To limit input data needs and to simplify calculations, the model assumes that water flows vertically downward under a unit gradient; infiltration and evapotranspiration are separate, sequential processes; evapotranspiration is allocated to evaporation and transpiration as a function of leaf-area index and is limited by soil-moisture content; and evaporation and transpiration are distributed through the soil profile as exponential functions of soil and root depth, respectively. For calibration, model-calculated water contents of 11 soil-depth intervals from 0 to 200 cm were compared with measured water contents of loam soil at four sites in Luancheng County, Hebei Province, over 3 years (1998-2001). Each 50-m2 site was identically cropped with winter wheat and summer maize, but received a different irrigation treatment. Average root mean-squared error between measured and model-calculated water content of the top 180 cm was 4·2 cm, or 9·3\% of average total water content. In addition, model-calculated evapotranspiration compared well with that measured by a large-scale lysimeter. To test the model, 12 additional sites were simulated successfully. Model results demonstrate that drainage from the soil profile is not a constant fraction of precipitation and irrigation inputs, but rather the fraction increases as the inputs increase. Because this drainage recharges the underlying aquifer, improving irrigation efficiency by reducing seepage will not reverse water-table declines.},

	abstract = {Maximum daily stream water temperature information is very important when assessing fish habitat in terms of distribution and fish growth rate. For instance, coldwater fishes such as the Atlantic salmon can be adversely affected by these maximum summer temperatures or by those exacerbated by land use practices such as deforestation. The present study deals with the modelling of maximum daily stream water temperatures using regression and stochastic models to relate air and water temperatures in Catamaran Brook, a small stream in New Brunswick where long-term multidisciplinary habitat research is being carried out. The regression model was a logistic type function while the stochastic model was based on the autocorrelation structure of the water temperature time series. The first step in the stochastic modelling was to establish the long-term annual component in stream water temperatures. This was possible by fitting a combination of a Fourier and Sine function to stream water temperatures. The short-term residual temperatures (departure from the long-term annual component) were modelled using a second order Markov process. Results showed that the regression type model was only possible on a weekly basis with a root-mean-square error ({RMSE}) of 1.93°C. Alternatively, the stochastic model showed that it was possible to predict maximum daily water temperatures for small streams using air temperatures only. The {RMSE} varied between 1.48 and 1.62°C on an annual basis from 1992 to 1997, which were lower than the regression model. Calibrations were carried out on a seasonal basis as well as during the summer of each year. However, the improvements in the modelling were less than 0.1°C. It was also noted that the empirical coefficient linking air to water temperatures residuals varied on a seasonal and summer basis, and this coefficient was related to summer discharge. Although variable, this empirical coefficient did not improve the modelling significantly on a seasonal or summer basis.},

The method uses a digital terrain model ({DTM}) of the area and regionalised climate data to derive the soil regionalised variables that form the basis of the prediction. The method was tested using 94 soil profile samples in the Quaternary stratum of the Schatterbach test site, a 2387 ha investigation area in the Bavarian Tertiary Hills (Germany). The approach is based on the assumption that the shape of the landscape and the late Quaternary climate history determines slope development and soil forming processes. To develop the method, a suite of terrain- indices and complex process parameters was derived from {DTM} and climate data. Step-wise linear regression was then used to identify which of these terrain indices and process parameters were most useful in predicting the required soil attributes. Testing of the approach showed that 88.1\% of the variance was explained by a combination of the sediment transport, mass balance and solifluction parameters, providing a sound basis for the prediction of soil parameters in hilly terrain.},

By using the simple non-linear storage based model, first proposed by Horton, an analytical solution of the overland flow equations over a plane hillslope was derived. This solution establishes a generalization for different flow regimes of Horton's original solution, which is valid for the transitional flow regime only. The solution proposed was compared successfully with that of Horton and, for the turbulent flow regime, to the one derived from kinematic wave theory. This solution can be applied easily to both stationary and non-stationary rainfall excess events. An analytical solution for the instantaneous response function ({IRF}) was also derived. Finally, simple expressions to compute peak and time to peak of {IRF} are proposed. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The flood from each subbasin is calculated by means of a design rainfall pattern convoluted with a unit hydrograph. Runoff coefficients and unit hydrographs are calculated from a regionalization model which has been developed from a large number of measured hydrographs. Flood routing models are used to connect the subcatchments. Application examples are shown, and trends for future developments are indicated.},

National and international efforts before that time created a healthy climate for the development of agrometeorology in Canada and the pioneering work in soil moisture and crop-weather modelling. Events in the early days leading to a concerted endeavour of soil moisture modelling included: (i) a small group of highly qualified professionals from different disciplines, as well as support staff, had been established under the guidance of a team leader at the then Plant Research Institute ({PRI}); ii) a Canada wide crop-weather study had produced daily climatological and crop data at nine Canada Department of Agriculture establishments over 10 yr (1953–1962); iii) a computer became available to {PRI} staff ({IBM} 1620 with 16K); and (v) several sub-models providing the necessary input to the soil moisture model were at various stages of development (e.g. the “latent” evaporation and the biometeorological time scale sub-models). This paper presents an overview of the development of the {VSMB} using standard climatological data for generating daily soil moisture estimates under crops. Its concept, design and widespread applications in Canada and abroad are discussed. A more detailed analysis is left to the other presentations at this Symposium.},

	abstract = {Estimating groundwater recharge is a key component in determining the sustainable yield of groundwater resources in arid and semi-arid areas such as southern California. Estimating groundwater recharge on a regional scale requires developing a water budget that incorporates data on boundary conditions, aquifer properties, groundwater levels, and groundwater production. The hydrological budget method proposed herein is simple, cost-effective, and easy to apply. It utilizes matched pairs of groundwater level measurements, groundwater extraction data, and distributed specific yield information for estimating groundwater recharge. In this method, {ARCGIS} 9.0 Geostatistical and Spatial Analyst applications are used for interpolating/extrapolating and creating grids for specific yield, bedrock elevation, and raw groundwater data. The annual average groundwater recharge for the Hemet subbasin in western Riverside County, California, from 1997 to 2005 is estimated at 12.5 {MCM}, with wet and dry periods ranging between 14.9 {MCM} and 11.7 {MCM}, respectively. The proposed method utilizes information commonly available to most groundwater management entities, such as groundwater production data, groundwater level measurements, and lithologic information.},

In order to develop the spatio-temporal estimates of aquifer recharge and to analyze to what extent urban growth has affected aquifer recharge, this work presents a daily soil water balance which uses different vegetation and soil types as well as the effect of topography on climatological variables and evapotranspiration. The soil water balance was applied on a daily time step in the Basin of Mexico for the period 1975–1986, obtaining an annually-lumped potential recharge flow of 10.9–23.8 m3/s (35.9–78.1 mm) in the entire Basin, while the monthly values for the year with the largest lumped recharge value (1981 = 78.1 mm) range from 1 m3/s (0.3 mm) in December to 87.9 m3/s (23.7 mm) in June. As aquifer recharge in the Basin mainly occurs by subsurface flow from its enclosing mountains as Mountain Block Recharge, urban growth has had a minimal impact on aquifer recharge, although it has diminished recharge in the alluvial plain.},

	abstract = {Air quality models are used to make decisions regarding the construction of industrial plants, the types of fuel that will be burnt and the types of pollution control devices that will be used. It is important to know the uncertainties that are associated with these model predictions. Standard analytical methods found in elementary statistics textbooks for estimating uncertainties are generally not applicable since the distributions of performance measures related to air quality concentrations are not easily transformed to a Gaussian shape. This paper suggests several possible resampling procedures that can be used to calculate uncertainties or confidence limits on air quality model performance. In these resampling methods, many new data sets are drawn from the original data set using an empirical set of rules. A few alternate forms of the socalled bootstrap and jackknife resampling procedures are tested using a concocted data set with a Gaussian parent distributions, with the result that the jackknife is the most efficient procedure to apply, although its confidence bounds are slightly overestimated. The resampling procedures are then applied to predictions by seven air quality models for the Carpinteria coastal dispersion experiment. Confidence intervals on the fractional mean bias and the normalized mean square error are calculated for each model and for differences between models. It is concluded that these uncertainties are sometimes so large for data sets consisting of about 20 elements that it cannot be stated with 95\% confidence that the performance measure for the ‘best’ model is significantly different from that for another model.},

	abstract = {Abstract This paper focuses on the identifiability problem of hydrological system modelling, taking implicit rainfall-runoff models as a target for study i.e. those models whose structures are nonlinear functions of their parameters. Because most implicit models and objective functions are very difficult as regards analytical solution or for finding high-order derivatives, a numerical analysis method is developed which not only can assess the identifiability problem but also can provide useful information for dealing with parameter optimization. The major studies involved are two-fold: (1) proposing a mathematical description and assessment method for the structural identifiability of hydrological models; and (2) providing a workable and robust identification technique using a rotating transformation of the parameter space. Using both generated error-free and watershed data in China, it has been verified that the approach is of significance and usefulness.},

	abstract = {Most runoff simulation and infiltration models have been developed at the global-catchment scale or the local-soil column scale. Few models have been specifically developed at the scale of agricultural fields and there are no guidelines to help modellers choose an adequate model to simulate overland flow and hence analyse the impact of different soil management practices on flood generation. A comparison is undertaken to select and calibrate models that simulate Hortonian overland flow at the field or small plot scale. The proposed methodology couples a runoff production model to a unit hydrograph transfer function. Four different models were tested: Philip, Morel-Seytoux, Horton and {SCS}. These models differ by their mathematical structure and the parameters to be calibrated while input hydrologic data are the same site data: rainfall/runoff and initial water content. The models are calibrated on 14 events and validated on 14 others. The results of both the calibration and validation phases are compared on the basis of their performance with regards to six objective criteria, three global criteria and three relative criteria representing volume, peakflow, and the root mean square error. The first type of criteria gives more weight to strong events whereas the second considers all events to be of equal weight. The results show that the calibrated parameter values are dependent on the type of objective criteria used. Furthermore, when analysing the performance of the six objective criteria used, it can be seen that the global volume, global {RMSE} and relative peakflow criteria give the best compromise between bias and precision. Within the selected modelling framework, Morel-Seytoux's model performed better than the other three and the {SCS} gave the worst results. Horton's model showed to be more consistent in overall performance than Philip's model. Results also highlight problems related to the simulation of low flow events and intermittent rainfall events.},

	abstract = {This research sought to identify the most relevant approach to calculate potential evapotranspiration ({PE}) for use in a daily rainfall–runoff model, while answering the following question: How can we use available atmospheric variables to represent the evaporative demand at the basin scale? The value of 27 {PE} models was assessed in terms of streamflow simulation efficiency over a large sample of 308 catchments located in France, Australia and the United States. While trying to identify which atmospheric variables were the most relevant to compute {PE} as input to rainfall–runoff models, we showed that the formulae based on temperature and radiation tend to provide the best streamflow simulations. Surprisingly, {PE} approaches based on the Penman approach seem less advantageous to feed rainfall–runoff models. This investigation has resulted in a proposal for a temperature-based {PE} model, combining simplicity and efficiency, and adapted to four rainfall–runoff models. This {PE} model only requires mean air temperature (derived from long-term averages) and leads to a slight but steady improvement in rainfall–runoff model efficiency.},

These components are modules for calculating potential and actual evapotranspiration, crop growth and soil water balance. Two different complex simulation models obtained from the modelling system were tested using field data from two arable test sites. The modelling results show the ability of this modelling system to simulate water balance and crop growth with acceptable precision. Additionally, the impact of a recombination of the two simulation model components on the simulations of the field data was analyzed. These recombinations include an exchange of the soil water balance modules, the crop-growth models and the formulae for calculating potential evapotranspiration. This analysis indicates that the type of soil water model used is the most essential consideration for simulating the dynamics of soil water contents and percolation. The exchange of crop models and the use of different modules for calculating potential evapotranspiration affect evaporation, transpiration and interception. The impact of these rearrangements on soil water dynamics was less significant than the effects from the different soil water models.},

	abstract = {Natural systems exhibit random, chaotic, and multiply periodic behaviors that are driven by gravity, weather, and man-made disturbances. Modeling them on a large scale is challenging because behaviors vary discontinuously both spatially and in time. Modeling requires calibration and validation data that represent a diversity of causes and effects. Measured variables are either categorical (static) or dynamic (time series). Integrating multiple data types and reducing large numbers of variables to a select set often leads to subjective decision-making that has significant ramifications when applying state-of-the-art multi-step modeling approaches, e.g., land-use models driving finite element flow models. This paper is Part 1 of a two-part treatment that describes an alternative approach that employs a sequence of numerically optimized data mining algorithms. They include 1) signal decomposition to separate static, chaotic and periodic time series components that are attributable to different forcing functions; 2) time series clustering to segment monitored sites by their dynamic behaviors; 3) non-linear, multivariate sensitivity analysis using multi-layer perceptron artificial neural networks ({ANN}) to determine the relative importance of categorical variables at predicting site-to-site behavioral variability; 4) spatially interpolating dynamic behaviors with {ANNs}; and 5) assembling an end-user application that integrates data, site attribute classifiers, and prediction models to model an expansive, behaviorally heterogeneous natural system. This paper also describes applications of this approach that predict water levels and stream temperatures.},

	title = {Ground-Water Availability in the Wailuku Area, Maui, Hawai'i},
	url = {http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20085236},
	abstract = {Most of the public water supply in Maui, Hawai'i, is from a freshwater lens in the Wailuku area of the island. Because of population growth, ground-water withdrawals from wells in this area increased from less than 10 Mgal/d during 1970 to about 23 Mgal/d during 2006. In response to increased withdrawals from the freshwater lens in the Wailuku area, water levels declined, the transition zone between freshwater and saltwater became shallower, and the chloride concentrations of water pumped from wells increased. These responses led to concern over the long-term sustainability of withdrawals from existing and proposed wells. A three-dimensional numerical ground-water flow and transport model was developed to simulate the effects of selected withdrawal and recharge scenarios on water levels, on the transition zone between freshwater and saltwater, and on surface-water/ground-water interactions. The model was constructed using time-varying recharge, withdrawals, and ocean levels. Hydraulic characteristics used to construct the model were initially based on published estimates but ultimately were varied to obtain better agreement between simulated and measured water levels and salinity profiles in the modeled area during the period 1926-2006. Scenarios included ground-water withdrawal at 2006 and 1996 rates and locations with average recharge (based on 2000-04 land use and 1926-2004 rainfall) and withdrawal at redistributed rates and locations with several different recharge scenarios. Simulation results indicate that continuing 1996 and 2006 withdrawal distributions into the future results in decreased water levels, a thinner freshwater lens, increased salinity from pumped wells, and higher salinity at several current withdrawal sites. A redistributed withdrawal condition in which ground-water withdrawal was redistributed to maximize withdrawal and minimize salinities in the withdrawn water was determined. The redistributed withdrawal simulates 27.1 Mgal/d of withdrawal from 14 wells or well fields in the Wailuku area. Simulation results from the five scenarios that include redistributed withdrawal conditions indicate the following for the Wailuku Aquifer Sector: (1) withdrawal during times of average recharge rates cause average water levels to decrease 2-3 ft and the transition zone to become more than 200 ft shallower after 150 years; (2) a 5-yr drought condition similar to the 1998-2002 drought results in additional salinity increases after 30 years (12.5 years of normal recharge after drought conditions) but only one well has salinity increases of concern; (3) additional recharge from restored streamflow significantly increases water levels, thickens the freshwater body, and decreases salinity at withdrawal sites in the Waihe'e and 'Iao Aquifer Systems; and (4) a complete removal of irrigation recharge decreases water levels and increases salinity in the central isthmus where irrigation is reduced, but recharge through restored streams still significantly increases water levels, thickens the freshwater body, and decreases salinity at withdrawal sites in the Waihe'e and 'Iao Aquifer Systems.},

The intent of this study was to increase the versatility of {SWAT} by developing the capability to simulate hydrology of a non-agricultural mountainous region with a large snowmelt component. A western Wyoming basin, representative of Rocky Mountain basins, was selected to evaluate model performance, identify governing hydrologic processes, and improve the snowmelt routine. An initial evaluation of {SWAT} performance indicated an inability of the model to represent snowmelt processes. Based on simulation results and field observations, algorithms were developed which use elevation bands to distribute temperature and precipitation with elevation. Additional routines which control snowpack temperature, meltwater production, and areal snow coverage were designed to simulate the influence of season and elevation on the evolution of basin snowpack. The development of the new snowmelt algorithms improved the average annual Nash-Sutcliffe R2 correlation between simulated and observed Wind River streamflow from an initial value of -0.70 to +0.86.},

	abstract = {Reliable estimates of areal evapotranspiration are essential to significant improvements in the science and practice of hydrology. Direct measurements, such as those provided by lysimeters, eddy flux instrumentation or Bowen-ratio instrumentation, give point values, require constant attendance by skilled personnel and are based on unverified assumptions. A critical review of the methods used for estimating areal evapotranspiration indicates that the conventional conceptual techniques, such as those used in current watershed models, are based on assumptions that are completely divorced from reality; and that causal techniques based on processes and interactions in the soil-plant-atmosphere system are not likely to prove useful for another generation. However, the complementary relationship can do much to fill the gap until such time as causal techniques become practicable because it provides the basis for models that permit areal evapotranspiration to be estimated from its effects on the routine climatological observations needed to estimate potential evapotranspiration. Such models have a realistic conceptual and empirical basis, by-pass the complexity of the soil-plant system and require no local calibration of coefficients. Therefore, they are falsifiable (i.e. can be tested rigorously) so that errors in the associated assumptions and relationships can be detected and corrected by progressive testing over an ever-widening range of environments. Such a methodology uses the entire world as a laboratory and requires that a correction made to obtain agreement between model and river-basin water budget estimates in one environment must be applicable without modification in all other environment. The most recent version of the complementary relationship areal evapotranspiration ({CRAE}) models is formulated and documented. The reliability of the independent operational estimates of areal evapotranspiration is tested with comparable long-term water-budget estimates for 143 river basins in North America, Africa, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. The practicality and potential impact of such estimates are demonstrated with examples which show how the availability of such estimates can revitalize the science and practice of hydrology by providing a reliable basis for detailed water-balance studies; for further research on the development of causal models; for hydrological, agricultural and fire hazard forecasts; for detecting the development of errors in hydrometeorological records; for detecting and monitoring the effects of land-use changes; for explaining hydrologic anomalies; and for other better known applications. It is suggested that the collection of the required climatological data by hydrometric agencies could be justified on the grounds that the agencies would gain a technique for quality control and the users would gain by a significant expansion in the information content of the hydrometric data, all at minimal additional expense.},

	abstract = {In this article we use moving averages to develop new classes of models in a flexible modeling framework for stream networks. Streams and rivers are among our most important resources, yet models with autocorrelated errors for spatially continuous stream networks have been described only recently. We develop models based on stream distance rather than on Euclidean distance. Spatial autocovariance models developed for Euclidean distance may not be valid when using stream distance. We begin by describing a stream topology. We then use moving averages to build several classes of valid models for streams. Various models are derived depending on whether the moving average has a “tail-up” stream, a “tail-down” stream, or a “two-tail” construction. These models also can account for the volume and direction of flowing water. The data for this article come from the Ecosystem Health Monitoring Program in Southeast Queensland, Australia, an important national program aimed at monitoring water quality. We model two water chemistry variables, {pH} and conductivity, for sample sizes close to 100. We estimate fixed effects and make spatial predictions. One interesting aspect of stream networks is the possible dichotomy of autocorrelation between flow-connected and flow-unconnected locations. For this reason, it is important to have a flexible modeling framework, which we achieve on the example data using a variance component approach.},

	abstract = {Two soil–water balance models were tested by a comparison of simulated with measured daily rates of actual evapotranspiration, soil water storage, groundwater recharge, and capillary rise. These rates were obtained from twelve weighable lysimeters with three different soils and two different lower boundary conditions for the time period from January 1, 1996 to December 31, 1998. In that period, grass vegetation was grown on all lysimeters. These lysimeters are located in Berlin-Dahlem, Germany. One model calculated the soil water balance using the Richards equation. The other one used a capacitance approach. Both models used the same modified Penman formula for the estimation of potential evapotranspiration and the same simple empirical vegetation model for the calculation of transpiration, interception, and evaporation. The comparisons of simulated with measured model outputs were analyzed using the modeling-efficiency index {IA} and the root mean squared error {RMSE}. At some lysimeters, the uncalibrated application of both models led to an underestimation of cumulative and annual rates of groundwater recharge and capillary rise, despite a good simulation quality in terms of {IA} and {RMSE}. A calibration of soil-hydraulic and vegetation parameters such as maximum rooting depth resulted in a better fit between simulated and observed cumulative and annual rates of groundwater recharge and capillary rise, but in some cases also decreased the simulation quality of both models in terms of {IA} and {RMSE}. The results of this calibration indicated that, in addition to a precise determination of the soil water-retention functions, vegetation parameters such as rooting depth should also be observed. Without such information, the rooting depth is a calibration parameter. However, in some cases, the uncalibrated application of both models also led to an acceptable fit between measured and simulated model outputs.},

	abstract = {Differences in the simulation of hydrologic processes by watershed models directly affect the accuracy of results. Surface runoff generation can be simulated as either: (1) infiltration-excess (or Hortonian) overland flow, or (2) saturation-excess overland flow. This study compared the Hydrological Simulation Program—{FORTRAN} ({HSPF}) and the Soil Moisture Routing ({SMR}) models, each representing one of these mechanisms. These two models were applied to a 102 km2 watershed in the upper part of the Irondequoit Creek basin in central New York State over a seven-year simulation period. The models differed in both the complexity of simulating snowmelt and baseflow processes as well as the detail in which the geographic information was preserved by each model.

Despite their differences in structure and representation of hydrologic processes, the two models simulated streamflow with almost equal accuracy. Since streamflow is an integral response and depends mainly on the watershed water balance, this was not unexpected. Model efficiency values for the seven-year simulation period were 0.67 and 0.65 for {SMR} and {HSPF}, respectively. {HSPF} simulated winter streamflow slightly better than {SMR} as a result of its complex snowmelt routine, whereas {SMR} simulated summer flows better than {HSPF} as a result of its runoff and baseflow processes.

An important difference between model results was the ability to predict the spatial distribution of soil moisture content. {HSPF} aggregates soil moisture content, which is generally related to a specific pervious land unit across the entire watershed, whereas {SMR} predictions of moisture content distribution are geographically specific and matched field observations reasonably well. Important is that the saturated area was predicted well by {SMR} and confirmed the validity of using saturation-excess mechanisms for this hillslope dominated watershed.},

Experiments were conducted at the Manfredi Experimental Station ({INTA}), Argentina (31°49'S, 63°48'W), and at the Institute of Phytopathology and Vegetal Physiology ({IFFIVE}), Cordoba, Argentina (31°24'S, 64°11'W). The soil was a silty loam Entic Haplustoll ({USDA} Soil Taxonomy) with A, {AC} and C horizons. The crops studied were: maize (Zea mays L.), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.), and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). Differences in apparent rooting depths among species and cultivars, ranging from 130 to 290 cm, were found. The comparison of the extraction front velocity ({EFV}) revealed differences among species but not among cultivars of the same species. {EFV} ranged from 44 mm day-1 for sunflower to 23 mm day-1 for peanut. In all the crops, the downward progress of the extraction front stopped at the beginning of the grain filling. Comparisons among the pooled rates of water extraction (kl) for depths from 10 to 110 cm, revealed significant differences among crops and cultivars within crops. The kl values ranged from 0.110 day-1 for Contiflor 3 sunflower to 0.029 day-1 for alfalfa. No significant correlation between kl values and root length density over 40 to 120 cm depths was found for soybean, indicating that the specific water uptake rate varies considerably in the soil profile.},

For each stream, historic precipitation and temperature data were used as input to an {ANN}, which generated a synthetic daily hydrograph with high goodness-of-fit \$(r{\textasciicircum}2 {\textgreater} 0.80)\$ . Four scenarios of climate change were used to evaluate stream responses to climate change: + 25\% precipitation, -25\% precipitation, 2 × the coefficient of variation in precipitation regime, and +3circC average temperature. Responses were expressed in hydrological terms of ecological relevance, including flow variabilitiy, baseflow conditions, and frequency and predictability of floods. Increased average precipitation induced elevated runoff and more frequent high flow events, while decreased precipitation had the opposite effect. Elevated temperature reduced average runoff. Doubled precipitation variability had a large effect on many variables, including average runoff, variability of flow, flooding frequency, and baseflow stability. In general, the rainfall-dominated stream exhibited greater relative response to climate change scenarios than did the snowmelt stream.},

Here we demonstrate that the decrease in autumn Arctic sea ice area is linked to changes in the winter Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation that have some resemblance to the negative phase of the winter Arctic oscillation. However, the atmospheric circulation change linked to the reduction of sea ice shows much broader meridional meanders in midlatitudes and clearly different interannual variability than the classical Arctic oscillation. This circulation change results in more frequent episodes of blocking patterns that lead to increased cold surges over large parts of northern continents. Moreover, the increase in atmospheric water vapor content in the Arctic region during late autumn and winter driven locally by the reduction of sea ice provides enhanced moisture sources, supporting increased heavy snowfall in Europe during early winter and the northeastern and midwestern United States during winter. We conclude that the recent decline of Arctic sea ice has played a critical role in recent cold and snowy winters.},

In order to preserve a lake-at-rest and the positivity of water depths in drying/wetting zones, the hydrostatic reconstruction proposed by Audusse et al. [1] is implemented on cut cell grids. In addition, the gradient construction method on cut cells proposed by Causon et al. [8] is modified due to the spurious calculation when a solid boundary is nearly parallel to grids. The numerical schemes mentioned above are employed in Gerris which is open source free software and provides a shallow water solver on adaptive quadtree grids. The applied numerical schemes are validated using four test simulations: still water in an inclined domain; oscillation in a parabolic container; shock reflection by a circular cylinder; flash flood experiment in a model city. The simulation results are compared with analytical solutions, experiment data and the results simulated by other researchers.},

A simple, causal, spatially distributed soil water balance model for estimating direct groundwater recharge is described. The potential use of this model is illustrated by the results of a study carried out in a Chalk surface water catchment in southern England. The study estimates the response of mean annual groundwater recharge to land cover changes which took place between 1990 and 1997. It is concluded that, in this case, the change in land cover significantly alters the pattern of recharge but, by coincidence, that the total for the catchment is unchanged.},

	abstract = {Recharge is a fundamental component of groundwater systems, and in groundwater-modeling exercises recharge is either measured and specified or estimated during model calibration. The most appropriate way to represent recharge in a groundwater model depends upon both physical factors and study objectives. Where the water table is close to the land surface, as in humid climates or regions with low topographic relief, a constant-head boundary condition is used. Conversely, where the water table is relatively deep, as in drier climates or regions with high relief, a specified-flux boundary condition is used. In most modeling applications, mixed-type conditions are more effective, or a combination of the different types can be used. The relative distribution of recharge can be estimated from water-level data only, but flux observations must be incorporated in order to estimate rates of recharge. Flux measurements are based on either Darcian velocities (e.g., stream baseflow) or seepage velocities (e.g., groundwater age). In order to estimate the effective porosity independently, both types of flux measurements must be available. Recharge is often estimated more efficiently when automated inverse techniques are used. Other important applications are the delineation of areas contributing recharge to wells and the estimation of paleorecharge rates using carbon-14.},

	abstract = {A relatively simple and practical approach for calculating groundwater recharge in semiarid plain environments with a relatively shallow water table, such as the Kansas Prairies, has been developed. Major uncertainties in the Darcian, water balance, and groundwater fluctuation analysis approaches were examined, and a combination methodology for reducing some of the uncertainties is proposed. By combining a storm-based soil water balance (lasting several days) with the resulting water table rise, effective storativity values of the region near the water table are obtained. This combination method is termed the 'hybrid water-fluctuation method.' Using a simple average of several such estimates results in a site-calibrated effective storativity value that can be used to translate each major water table rise tied to a specific storm period into a corresponding amount of groundwater recharge. Estimation errors in the hybrid water-fluctuation method are reduced by running a 'storm period '-based soil water balance throughout the year in combination with the associated water level rise, and by employing the {CRAE} methodology for areal evapotranspiration estimates, thus avoiding the soil-plant system complexities. Examples of soil water balance and water level fluctuation analyses based on field-measured data from Kansas show that the proposed methodology gives better and more reliable results than either of the two well-established approaches used singly.

	abstract = {The influence of soil texture on the rooting patterns of Thompson Seedless (syn. Sultana) grapevines (Vitis vinifera) on own roots or on Ramsey rootstock (Vitis champim) was studied in irrigated vineyards. Root samples were collected using an auger at 30-, 90-, and 120-cm positions from vine trunks and perpendicular to the vine row. At each position, roots were collected at 20-cm depth intervals down the soil profile and the total length of roots measured in each sample. The root length data was used to calculate the root density (mm/cm3) in each 20-cm depth interval of the soil profile. The soil in the root zone was characterized by measuring the silt + clay content and bulk density. The soil texture in sampled vineyards was either coarse, moderately coarse, or fine. Rooting depths were 220 cm in coarse soil, 100 to 120 cm in moderately coarse soil, and 60 to 120 cm in fine soil. In coarse soil, roots were well spread throughout the soil profile, whereas roots were concentrated in the top 40 to 60 cm in both moderately coarse and fine soil. Maximum root densities measured were 0.4 mm/cm3 in coarse soil, 0.8 to 1 mm/cm3 in moderately coarse soil, and 0.7 to 1.7 mm/cm3 in fine soil. The lateral spread of roots in the traffic row was not dependent on soil texture. Further, in most vineyards sampled, the vines did not show a marked reduction in root growth in the traffic row. Ramsey rootstock vines showed more extensive root growth than own-rooted Thompson Seedless vines, particularly in the deeper layers of the soil.},

Although these expansions do not converge near the branch point of the W function (corresponds to Green–Ampt infiltration with immediate ponding), a method is presented for approximating W−1 that is exact at the branch point and asymptotically, with interpolation between these limits. Some existing and several new simple and compact yet robust approximations applicable to Green–Ampt infiltration and flux are presented, the most accurate of which has a maximum relative error of 5\&\#xa0;×\&\#xa0;10−5\%.

	shorttitle = {A single layer soil water balance model for estimating deep drainage (potential recharge)},
	abstract = {The understanding and quantification of groundwater recharge in semi-arid areas are fundamental to sound management of water resources in such areas. A soil water balance model, if designed to adequately represent the physical processes involved, and if carried out with a short enough (daily) time step, can provide realistic estimates of deep drainage (potential recharge) over long periods.

We describe a single store (single layer) mass water balance model applicable to semi-arid areas, which recognises the wetting of the near surface during rainfall, with subsequent availability of water for evaporation and transpiration in the days following rainfall. The model allows for the major hydrological processes taking place at or near the soil-vegetation surface including runoff.

Model results are presented for North-east Nigeria, for a continuous period of 36 years during which mean annual rainfall was 431 mm (range 321–650 mm) and mean annual modelled deep drainage was 14 mm (range 0–95 mm, with 23 years having zero potential recharge). The modelling results indicate that annual rainfall totals are not the main predictor of annual recharge. The temporal distribution of daily rainfall and the magnitude of the antecedent (pre-season) soil moisture deficit are the strongest determinants of deep drainage at a particular location, in a particular year. Sensitivity analysis of soil and vegetation parameters suggests that deep drainage is most sensitive to water holding capacity and rooting depth. These are key parameters which determine spatial variability of potential recharge.

The model is shown to be plausible by examination of the concepts which underlie it, by comparison with field soil moisture measurements, and by the model's ability to represent qualitative observations of crop yield variations from year to year.

Future development of the model could include applications to other climatic conditions and the inclusion of other hydrologic processes.},

	abstract = {There is a deep disconnect between scientific and public concern about climate change. One reason is that global climate change is a fairly abstract concept with little perceived relevance, so a key challenge is to translate climate-change projections into locally concrete examples of potential impacts. Here we use climate analog analyses as an alternative method for identifying and communicating climate-change impacts. Our analysis uses multiple downscaled general circulation models for the state of Wisconsin, at 0.1 decimal degree resolution, and identifies contemporary locations in North America that are the most similar to the projected future climates for Wisconsin. We assess the uncertainties inherent in climate-change projections among greenhouse gas emission scenarios, time windows (mid-21st century vs. late 21st-century) and different combinations of climate variables. For all future scenarios and simulations, contemporary climatic analogs within North America were found for Wisconsin’s future climate. Closest analogs are primarily 200–500 km to the south-southwest of their Wisconsin reference location. Temperature has the largest effect on choice of climatic analog, but precipitation is the greatest source of uncertainty. Under the higher-end emission scenarios, the contemporary climatic analogs for Wisconsin’s end-21st-century climates are almost entirely outside the state. Climate-analog analyses offer a place-based means of assessing climate impacts that is complementary to the species-based approaches of species distributional models, and carries no assumptions about the characterization and conservatism of species niches. The analog method is simple and flexible, and can be readily extended to other regions and other environmental variables.},

	abstract = {Applications of grid-based systems are widespread in many areas of environmental analysis. In this study, the concept is adapted to the modeling of water temperature by integrating a macroscale hydrologic model, variable infiltration capacity ({VIC}), with a computationally efficient and accurate water temperature model. The hydrologic model has been applied to many river basins at scales from 0.0625° to 1.0°. The water temperature model, which uses a semi-Lagrangian numerical scheme to solve the one-dimensional, time-dependent equations for thermal energy balance in advective river systems, has been applied and tested on segmented river systems in the Pacific Northwest. The state-space structure of the water temperature model described in previous work is extended to include propagation of uncertainty. Model results focus on proof of concept by comparing statistics from a study of a test basin with results from other studies that have used either process models or statistical models to estimate water temperature. The results from this study compared favorably with those of selected case studies using data-driven statistical models. The results for deterministic process models of water temperature were generally better than the grid-based method, particularly for those models developed from site-specific, data-intensive studies. Biases in the results from the grid-based system are attributed to heterogeneity in hydraulic characteristics and the method of estimating headwater temperatures.},

This study considers recharge to aquifers underlying river-incised glaciated terrain where the distribution of clay-rich till is largely intact in upland locations but has been removed by alluvial erosion in stream valleys. In a stream-dissected glacial region in eastern Nebraska (Great Plains region of the United States), recharge estimates were developed for nested profile, aquifer, and regional scales using unsaturated zone profile measurements (matric potentials, Cl− and 3H), groundwater tracers ({CFC}-12 and {SF}6), and a remote sensing-assisted water balance model. Results show a consistent influence of till lithology on recharge rates across nested spatial scales despite substantial uncertainty in all recharge estimation methods, suggesting that minimal diffuse recharge occurs through upland glacial till lithology whereas diffuse recharge occurs in river valleys where till is locally absent. Diffuse recharge is estimated to account for a maximum of 61\% of total recharge based on comparison of diffuse recharge estimated from the unsaturated zone (0–43 mm yr−1) and total recharge estimated from groundwater tracers (median 58 mm yr−1) and water balance modeling (median 56 mm yr−1). The results underscore the importance of lithologic controls on the distributions of both recharge rates and mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Many ecosystems have evolved under conditions where ground water is critical to the survival of the unique species contained therein. One example is Nebraska’s Sand Hills fens. The Sand Hills region comprises lush interdunal valleys amid grass-stabilized dunes. One valley type, fens, are ground water-fed wetlands that have several meters of saturated, organic soils comprising peat formed under anaerobic conditions where plant growth exceeds decomposition. These fens support unique flora and fauna such as rush aster and northern redbelly dace that are typically found in more boreal regions of North America. This study characterized the hydrogeology of a representative fen in the Jumbo Valley to explore how these relict species survive in a hot, arid climate and to understand present and historical relations between ground water and these unique ecosystems. Results indicate that ground water’s present role in sustaining the fens is twofold: (1) wetland plant transpiration of shallow ground water across the valley creates a cooler, humid microclimate that sustains the fens in the region’s hot, arid climate and (2) the large volume of ground water pumped through the fens by plant transpiration transports necessary nutrients to the root zone. Results suggest that, in the past, in addition to its sustaining role, ground water also played a vital role in fen development and in fen preservation through nearly 15,000 years of existence. Thus, as with like ecosystems, the role of ground water must be considered in future Sand Hills fen protection, restoration, and management.},

It considers the variety and reliability of measurement techniques that have been used and interprets the results of interception studies in relation to methodological, vegetational and climatic factors. The review illustrates that it is difficult to draw general conclusions about interception losses by particular forest types because they almost always depend on the type of rainfall and other meteorological conditions during the study period. Characteristics of a forest that affect interception are not always easy to identify and quantify. Characteristics such as trees/ha, branch angle, the uniformity or lack of uniformity in crown height, the nature and thickness of the bark layer, leaf shape and inclination, and leaf area index will all influence interception. The major difficulty is reliable estimation of throughfall. It is not unusual for measured throughfall to exceed the rainfall value, causing interception to be negative. The difficulty in estimation of throughfall is discussed, while also addressing the need for accurate measurement of rainfall. In forests where stemflow volumes are large enough to significantly influence the interception values, the methodological approach is even more difficult. Measurement of interception on a periodic basis presents fewer problems than estimation on an individual event basis because the variables that affect the values of throughfall and stemflow can change over very short periods, for example the intensity and angle of rainfall, and wind speed and direction. However, carefully conducted event-based studies can quantify the influence of a number of the variables. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The impact of preferential flow on recharge and contaminant transport poses a considerable challenge to water-resources management. Typical hydrologic models require extensive site characterization, but can underestimate fluxes when preferential flow is significant. A recently developed source-responsive model incorporates film-flow theory with conservation of mass to estimate unsaturated-zone preferential fluxes with readily available data. The term source-responsive describes the sensitivity of preferential flow in response to water availability at the source of input. We present the first rigorous tests of a parsimonious formulation for simulating water table fluctuations using two case studies, both in arid regions with thick unsaturated zones of fractured volcanic rock. Diffuse flow theory cannot adequately capture the observed water table responses at both sites; the source-responsive model is a viable alternative. We treat the active area fraction of preferential flow paths as a scaled function of water inputs at the land surface then calibrate the macropore density to fit observed water table rises. Unlike previous applications, we allow the characteristic film-flow velocity to vary, reflecting the lag time between source and deep water table responses. Analysis of model performance and parameter sensitivity for the two case studies underscores the importance of identifying thresholds for initiation of film flow in unsaturated rocks, and suggests that this parsimonious approach is potentially of great practical value.},

	abstract = {Abstract The Natural Resources Conservation Service ({NRCS}) [previously Soil Conservation Service ({SCS})] developed the {SCS} runoff curve-number ({CN}) method for estimating direct runoff from storm rainfall. The {NRCS} uses the {CN} method for designing structures and for evaluating their effectiveness. Structural design is usually based on a single event of a certain probability of occurrence. During the years when many floodwater-retarding watershed projects were planned and constructed (1950–1980), the {CN} equation was used in a continuous mode to evaluate the projects. To operate {CN} in a continuous mode, runoff was estimated from a daily rainfall record of approximately 30 years. For each day of recorded rainfall, the five-day antecedent rainfall was used to assign a (dry condition), (average condition), or (wet condition), and runoff was estimated with the appropriate {CN}. With the development of continuous hydrologic simulation models, {CN} was related directly to soil water content or estimated using rainfall and potential evapotranspiration ({PET}) to drive an index. Several methods were attempted and used with different degrees of success over a period of many years. The purpose of this study is to describe the evolution of the continuous {CN} method and its recent developments. Test results on the basis of the direct-link soil-moisture approach and the revised soil-moisture index method are presented for demonstration purposes. The results indicate that the revised soil-moisture index method is robust and produces realistic runoff estimates over a wide range of soil properties.},

	abstract = {Discharge in many rivers is often fed by outflow from a shallow groundwater reservoir. It is becoming clear that the outflow from this aquifer is not linearly proportional to storage as is commonly assumed in many algorithms. Numerical analysis of flow recession curves from about 100 river gauging stations instead reveals a nonlinear relationship between baseflow, Q, and storage, S, for which the equation S={aQb} was adopted. Values of the exponent b are found by calibration to be between 0 and 1 but with a high concentration around 0·5, which is in accordance with the findings of other studies and theoretical approaches yielding b=0·5 for unconfined aquifers and relating the coefficient a to catchment properties, primarily area and shape of basin, pore volume and transmissivity. This non-linear reservoir function is proposed as a more realistic alternative to the linear reservoir function.The relatively fast response of groundwater flow to rainfall is mainly a result of the increase of hydraulic head of the groundwater reservoir accelerating the exfiltration of ‘old’, pre-event water into the river bed. As fissure and pore volumes communicate hydraulically, it appears physically reasonable to model the system by one non-linear reservoir for catchments, or parts of them, instead of applying independent parallel linear reservoirs. The non-linear reservoir algorithms are supported by an analytical derivation. They are extended for the automatic separation of baseflow from a time-series of daily discharge in rivers and the computation of storage and effective recharge of groundwater in river basins by inverse nonlinear reservoir routing. The time-series obtained allow the identification and quantification of long-term changes to the water balance. Relationships between computed groundwater storage and observed groundwater level can also be established. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Summary
Climate change will change availability, quality and allocation of regional water resources. Appropriate modelling tools should therefore be available to realistically describe reactions of watersheds to climate change and to identify efficient and effective adaptation strategies on the regional scale. The paper presents the hydrologic model {PROMET} (Processes of Radiation, Mass and Energy Transfer), which was developed within the {GLOWA}-Danube project as part of the decision support system {DANUBIA}. {PROMET} covers the coupled water and energy fluxes of large-scale (A ∼ 100,000 km2) watersheds. It is fully spatially distributed, raster-based with raster-elements of 1 km2 area, runs on an hourly time step, strictly conserves mass and energy and is not calibrated using measured discharges. Details on the model concept and the individual model components are given.

An application case of {PROMET} is given for the mountainous Upper-Danube watershed in Central Europe (A = 77,000 km2). The water resources are intensively utilized for hydropower, agriculture, industry and tourism. The water flows are significantly influenced by man-made structures like reservoirs and water diversions. A 33-years model run covering the period from 1971 to 2003 using the existing meteorological station network as input is used to validate the performance of {PROMET} against measured stream flow data. Three aspects of the model performance were validated with good to very good results: the annual variation of the water balance of the whole watershed and selected sub-watersheds, the daily runoff for the whole period at selected gauges and the annual flood peaks and low flows (minimum 7-days average).

{PROMET} is used to investigate the impact of climate change on the water cycle of the Upper Danube. A stochastic climate generator is fed with two scenarios of climate development until 2060. One assumes no future temperature change, the other uses the temperature trends of the {IPCC}-A1B climate change scenario. {PROMET} is run with both climate data sets. No change in low-flow is detected when no temperature change is assumed. The {IPCC}-A1B climate scenario results in marked decreases of low-flow at the outlet of the watershed.},

	abstract = {Both climate change and human activities are known to have induced changes to hydrology. Consequently, quantifying the net impact of human contribution to the streamflow change is a challenge. In this paper, a decomposition method based on the Budyko hypothesis is used to quantify the climate (i.e., precipitation and potential evaporation change) and direct human impact on mean annual streamflow ({MAS}) for 413 watersheds in the contiguous United States. The data for annual precipitation, runoff, and potential evaporation are obtained from the international Model Parameter Estimation Experiment ({MOPEX}), which is often assumed to only include gauges unaffected by human interferences. The data are split into two periods (1948–1970 and 1971–2003) to quantify the change over time. Although climate is found to affect {MAS} more than direct human impact, the results show that assuming the {MOPEX} data set to be unaffected by human activities is far from realistic. Climate change causes increasing {MAS} in most watersheds, while the direct human-induced change is spatially heterogeneous in the contiguous United States, with strong regional patterns, e.g., human activities causing increased {MAS} in the Midwest and significantly decreased {MAS} in the High Plains. The climate- and human-induced changes are found to be more severe in arid regions, where water is limited. Comparing the results to a collection of independent data sets indicates that the estimated direct human impacts on {MAS} in this largely nonurban set of watersheds might be attributed to several human activities, such as cropland expansion, irrigation, and the construction of reservoirs.},

	abstract = {Rivers in watersheds dominated by agriculture throughout the {US} are impaired by excess sediment, a significant portion of which comes from non-field, near-channel sources. Both land-use and climate have been implicated in altering river flows and thereby increasing stream-channel erosion and sediment loading. In the wetland-rich landscapes of the upper Mississippi basin, 20th century crop conversions have led to an intensification of artificial drainage, which is now a critical component of modern agriculture. At the same time, much of the region has experienced increased annual rainfall. Uncertainty in separating these drivers of streamflow fuels debate between agricultural and environmental interests on responsibility and solutions for excess riverine sediment. To disentangle the effects of climate and land-use, we compared changes in precipitation, crop conversions, and extent of drained depressional area in 21 Minnesota watersheds over the past 70 years. Watersheds with large land-use changes had increases in seasonal and annual water yields of {\textgreater}50\% since 1940. On average, changes in precipitation and crop evapotranspiration explained less than one-half of the increase, with the remainder highly correlated with artificial drainage and loss of depressional areas. Rivers with increased flow have experienced channel widening of 10–40\% highlighting a source of sediment seldom addressed by agricultural best management practices.

	abstract = {Summary
The methods kriging with external drift ({KED}) and indicator kriging with external drift ({IKED}) are used for the spatial interpolation of hourly rainfall from rain gauges using additional information from radar, daily precipitation of a denser network, and elevation. The techniques are illustrated using data from the storm period of the 10th to the 13th of August 2002 that led to the extreme flood event in the Elbe river basin in Germany. Cross-validation is applied to compare the interpolation performance of the {KED} and {IKED} methods using different additional information with the univariate reference methods nearest neighbour ({NN}) or Thiessen polygons, inverse square distance weighting ({IDW}), ordinary kriging ({OK}) and ordinary indicator kriging ({IK}). Special attention is given to the analysis of the impact of the semivariogram estimation on the interpolation performance. Hourly and average semivariograms are inferred from daily, hourly and radar data considering either isotropic or anisotropic behaviour using automatic and manual fitting procedures.

The multivariate methods {KED} and {IKED} clearly outperform the univariate ones with the most important additional information being radar, followed by precipitation from the daily network and elevation, which plays only a secondary role here. The best performance is achieved when all additional information are used simultaneously with {KED}. The indicator-based kriging methods provide, in some cases, smaller root mean square errors than the methods, which use the original data, but at the expense of a significant loss of variance. The impact of the semivariogram on interpolation performance is not very high. The best results are obtained using an automatic fitting procedure with isotropic variograms either from hourly or radar data.},

	abstract = {{AESTRACT} An evaluation of the Maxey-Eakin method for calculating recharge to ground-water basins in Nevada was performed. The evaluation consisted of comparing Maxey-Eakin estimates with independent estimates of recharge, and analyzing the nature of the differences between the groups of estimates. In the comparison with the Maxey-Eakin estimates, two different groups of independent estimates were used: (1) 40 recharge estimates that were identified from water budgets contained in reports by the Nevada Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and (2) 27 recharge estimates that were identified from previous studies that used models. The results of the comparisons indicate generally good agreement between the Maxey-Eakin estimates and both groups of independent estimates. To quantify this agreement, an analysis was conducted to estimate the uncertainty in the Maxey-Eakin method. The analysis produced an upper bound on the standard deviation of the Maxey-Eakin estimate for a given basin. For the group of 40 water-budget estimates, the upper bound on the standard deviation for an individual basin is 4,800 acre-ft/yr, and the corresponding coefficient of variation of the Maxey-Eakin estimate is no greater than 44 percent. For the group of 27 model estimates, the upper bound on the standard deviation is 4,100 acre-ft/yr, and the corresponding coefficient of variation is no greater than 24 percent.},

A statistical bias correction methodology for global climate simulations is developed and applied to daily land precipitation and mean, minimum and maximum daily land temperatures. The bias correction is based on a fitted histogram equalization function. This function is defined daily, as opposed to earlier published versions in which they were derived yearly or seasonally at best, while conserving properties of robustness and eliminating unrealistic jumps at seasonal or monthly transitions. The methodology is tested using the newly available global dataset of observed hydrological forcing data of the last 50 years from the {EU} project {WATCH} ({WATer} and global {CHange}) and an initial conditions ensemble of simulations performed with the {ECHAM}5 global climate model for the same period. Bias corrections are derived from 1960 to 1969 observed and simulated data and then applied to 1990–1999 simulations. Results confirm the effectiveness of the methodology for all tested variables. Bias corrections are also derived using three other non-overlapping decades from 1970 to 1999 and all members of the {ECHAM}5 initial conditions ensemble. A methodology is proposed to use the resulting “ensemble of bias corrections” to quantify the error in simulated scenario projections of components of the hydrological cycle.},

	abstract = {Salinization of soil is a major problem in arid and semi-arid regions with saline shallow water table. This is influenced by climate, soil type, crop, irrigation water quality and management practice, depth to water table, and salinity of the water table. Modelling can be used for estimating capillary rise and salinity of soil profile with saline shallow water table. The objective of this study was to modify a transient state analytical model ({TSAM}) for estimating capillary rise and salinity of soil profile with different saline water table depths and salinities under irrigated and non-irrigated conditions in a micro-lysimeter. In the modified {TSAM} variable root depth, non-uniform water uptake pattern and a more complete water balance equation were included. Modified {TSAM} resulted in good agreement between measured and estimated cumulative and weekly capillary rise for wheat experiment. Furthermore, this modified model predicted the capillary rise and salinity of different soil layers for various water table depths (0.3–1.20 m) and salinity levels (0.5–13.0 {dS} m−1) under irrigated and non-irrigated conditions accurately. However, the prediction accuracy of capillary rise for a highly saline water table (13.0 {dS} m−1) and shallow water table depth (smaller than 0.6 m) was rather poor. This might has been occurred due to the effects of high soil salinity in the root zone on the roots water uptake reduction. Furthermore, the modified {TSAM} responded accurately to both irrigated and non-irrigated conditions. When the application of the numerical models to larger irrigation areas with varying soil types, depth to water table and agronomic practice may not be feasible, the modified {TSAM} may be suitable for estimating short-term mean rate of capillary rise, net long-term capillary rise and season soil salinities in different soil layers.},

The model simulates a coupled surface water and groundwater system in which a lumped conceptual model is used to model one-dimensional movement through the unsaturated zone, and a distributed model is used to simulate three-dimensional saturated groundwater flow. Movement of water through the unsaturated zone was found to be dominated by macropore flow, and accordingly the classical matrix flow approximations described by the Richards equation were not used. Instead, a conceptual model of the unsaturated zone was developed to simulate soil infiltration, recharge to the underlying groundwater system, capillary rise and crop evaporation on a daily time-step for each active cell within the model domain. Subsurface lateral flow between each vertical soil column is not permitted, though once in the saturated zone lateral flows are handled by the groundwater model. Salt movement through the profile is simulated using a mass balance approach, and separate conceptual formulations are used to generate salt export along the drainage lines.

	abstract = {The exchange of heat across the air-water interface is one of the more important factors that govern the temperature of a water body. The net rate of heat exchange at the water surface is the sum of the rates at which heat is transferred by radiative processes, by evaporation, and by conduction between water and overlying air. The net rate can be evaluated in terms of a thermal exchange coefficient and an equilibrium temperature, both of which depend on observable meteorological variables. Any one of the many evaporation formulas and mathematical descriptions of the other heat exchange processes may be used to develop equations involving the thermal exchange coefficient and equilibrium temperature. Such equations are useful in developing relations that describe the temporal and spatial temperature distributions within a water body. They provide additional insight into the effects of meteorological conditions on water temperatures, and they facilitate estimates of various terms of the heat budget.},

	abstract = {Monthly evapotranspiration ({ET}) rates (2000 to 2009) across Nebraska at about 1-km resolution were obtained by linear transformations of the {MODIS} ({MODerate} resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) daytime surface temperature values with the help of the Priestley–Taylor equation and the complementary relationship of evaporation. For positive values of the mean annual precipitation and {ET} differences, the mean annual net recharge was found by an additional multiplication of the power-function-transformed groundwater vulnerability {DRASTIC}-code values. Statewide mean annual net recharge became about 29 mm (i.e., 5\% of mean annual precipitation) with the largest recharge rates (in excess of 100 mm/year) found in the eastern Sand Hills and eastern Nebraska. Areas with the largest negative net recharge rates caused by declining groundwater levels due to large-scale irrigation are found in the south-western region of the state. Error bounds of the estimated values are within 10\% to 15\% of the corresponding precipitation rates and the estimated net recharge rates are sensitive to errors in the precipitation and {ET} values. This study largely confirms earlier base-flow analysis-based statewide groundwater recharge estimates when considerations are made for differences in the recharge definitions. The current approach not only provides better spatial resolution than available earlier studies for the region but also quantifies negative net recharge rates that become especially important in numerical modeling of shallow groundwater systems.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present a model that can reconstruct water table position and soil temperature profiles to 3 m depth in boreal mixed mire systems using the readily available climate data on air temperature and precipitation as driving variables. The model simulates complete, multiple annual cycles including winter conditions and freeze-thaw processes. The major requisite for an accurate description of the soil heat flux in a mire is an accurate description of the water content of the profile because of the high porosity of the soil and the thermal properties of water. The soil moisture profile in this model is described as a function of water table position derived from empirical published data of soil moisture profile measurements at different water table positions. The parameters of the model were set and tested for a lawn community, one of the most dominant plant communities occurring in boreal mixed mires. The model is optimized for the period 1995–1997 at the mixed mire Degerö Stormyr and was validated for the period 1997–1998 at the same location and for 1991–1993 at Storåmyran, 60 km away. The mean deviation of simulated to measured soil temperature from 10 cm to 3 m depth in the validation data sets was {\textless}1.6°C with a maximal standard deviation of 1.8°C. A response analysis of the amount of winter precipitation showed the influence of snow cover depth on soil frost fluctuations. A simulated precipitation corresponding to 25\% of the measured precipitation during winter 1995–1996, with all other factors unchanged, prolonged the period of frozen ground in the model from June 8 to August 1. With a doubling of the winter precipitation the modeled period of frozen ground lasted only until May 6.},

	abstract = {Stable isotopes of precipitation, ground water and surface water measured on the windward side of East Maui from 0 to 3055 m altitude were used to determine recharge sources for stream flow and ground water. Correct interpretation of the hydrology using rainfall ??18O gradients with altitude required consideration of the influence of fog, as fog samples had isotopic signatures enriched by as much as 3??? in ??18O and 21??? in ??D compared to volume-weighted average precipitation at the same altitude. The isotopic analyses suggested that fog drip was a major component of stream flow and shallow ground water at higher altitudes in the watershed. 18O/altitude gradients in rainfall were comparable for similar microclimates on Maui (this study) and Hawaii Island (1990-1995 study), however, East Maui ??18O values for rain in trade-wind and high-altitude microclimates were enriched compared to those from Hawaii Island. Isotopes were used to interpret regional hydrology in this volcanic island aquifer system. In part of the study area, stable isotopes indicate discharge of ground water recharged at least 1000 m above the sample site. This deep-flowpath ground water was found in springs from sea level up to 240 m altitude, indicating saturation to altitudes much higher than a typical freshwater lens. These findings help in predicting the effects of ground water development on stream flow in the area. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

	title = {Ground Water and Surface Water in the Haiku Area, East Maui, Hawaii},
	url = {http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/wri984142},
	abstract = {The Haiku study area lies on the gently sloping eastern flank of the East Maui Volcano (Haleakala) between the drainage basins of Maliko Gulch to the west and Kakipi Gulch to the east. The study area lies on the northwest rift zone of East Maui Volcano, a geologic feature 3 to 5 miles wide marked by surface expressions such as cinder, spatter, and pumice cones. The study area contains two geologic units, the main shield-building stage Honomanu Basalt and the Kula Volcanics. The hydraulic conductivity of the Honomanu Basalt was estimated to be between 1,000 and 3,600 feet per day on the basis of aquifer tests and 3,300 feet per day on the basis of the regional recharge rate and observed ground-water heads. The hydraulic conductivity of the Kula Volcanics is expected to be several orders of magnitude lower. An estimated 191 million gallons per day of rainfall and 22 million gallons per day of fog drip reach the study area and about 98 million gallons per day enters the ground-water system as recharge. Nearly all of the ground water currently withdrawn in the study area is from well 5520-01 in Maliko Gulch, where historic withdrawal rates have averaged about 2.8 million gallons per day. An additional 18 million gallons per day of ground-water withdrawal is proposed. Flow in Waiohiwi Gulch, a tributary to Maliko Gulch, is perennial between about 2,000 ft and 4,000 ft altitude. At lower altitudes in Maliko Gulch, flow is perennial at only a few spots downstream of springs and near the coast. The Kuiaha and Kaupakulua Gulch systems are usually dry from sea level to an altitude of 350 feet and gain water from about 350 feet to about 900 feet altitude. The two main branches of the Kaupakulua Gulch system alternately gain and lose water as high as 2,400 feet altitude. Kakipi Gulch has perennial flow over much of its length but is often dry near the coast below 400 feet altitude. Fresh ground water occurs in two main forms: (1) as perched high-level water held up by relatively low-permeability geologic layers, and (2) as a freshwater lens floating on denser, underlying saltwater. The rocks beneath the contact between the Kula Volcanics and the underlying Honomanu Basalt and above the freshwater lens appear to be unsaturated on the basis of several observations: (1) streams are dry or losing water where they are incised into the Honomanu Basalt, (2) the hydraulic conductivity of the Honomanu Basalt is too high to support a thick ground-water lens given the estimated recharge to the study area, and (3) wells that penetrate through the contact have encountered conditions of cascading water from above the contact and dry lava tubes in the Honomanu},

The most critical points of this method are the measurements of vertical humidity gradients, and long-term operation. We propose a simple system, using a capacitive hygrometer and alternate sampling of air at two levels with pumps to measure humidity gradients. It is well adapted to long-term measurements: low power consumption, low charge of maintenance, and low cost. It has been tested by comparison of hourly sensible and latent heat flux measurements performed by both eddy correlation and Bowen ratio, over a bare soil field and a fully evaporating canopy. Results are satisfactory over a large range of fluxes (0–400 W m−2) under daytime conditions. The main sources and magnitude of errors were investigated under the contrasted situations of bare soil and fully evaporating canopy. The system was shown to give good flux estimates even with very low humidity gradients.},

(2005) pointed out several inconsistencies in the soil moisture accounting ({SMA}) procedure used in the {SCS}-{CN} method and developed a procedure that is more consistent from the {SMA} viewpoint. However, the model proposed by them does not have any expression for initial soil moisture store level (V0) and hence there is a scope for further improvement. Like the original method, there is sudden jump in V0 and therefore a quantum jump in computed runoff is possible. In the present study, an attempt is made to develop an expression for V0 to make the model a continuous watershed model. Then, the performance of the new model is compared with the model proposed by Michel et al. and the original {SCS}-{CN} model by applying them in a large number of small watersheds in the United States. The present model was found to perform significantly better than both the original {SCS}-{CN} model and the model proposed by Michel et al. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Although the physical basis of the method has been debated, several researchers have suggested that it can be used to predict the watershed fraction that is saturated and generating runoff by saturation excess from variable source areas ({VSAs}). In this paper, we compare saturated runoff-contributing areas predicted with the {VSA} interpretation of the {SCS}-{CN} method with field-measured {VSAs} in a 0.5 ha hillslope in central New York State. We installed a trench below a {VSA} and simultaneously recorded water flux from different soil layers at the trench face and water table dynamics upslope of the trench. This setup allowed us to monitor runoff initiation and saturation-excess overland flow in response to rainfall and different water table depths in the hillslope during 16 storm events. We found that the {SCS}-{CN} method accurately predicted the observed {VSA} and showed best agreement if the {VSA} was defined as the area where the water table was within 10 cm of the soil surface. These results not only demonstrate that the {VSA} interpretation of the {SCS}-{CN} method accurately predicts {VSA} extents in small watersheds but also that the transient water table does not necessarily need to intersect the land surface to cause a storm runoff response.},

The {SCS}-{CN} is a simple and valuable approach to quantify the total streamflow volume generated by storm rainfall, but its use is not appropriate for estimating the sub-daily incremental rainfall excess. To overcome this drawback, we propose to include the Green-Ampt ({GA}) infiltration model into a mixed procedure, which is referred to as Curve Number for Green-Ampt ({CN}4GA), aiming to distribute in time the information provided by the {SCS}-{CN} method. For a given storm, the computed {SCS}-{CN} total net rainfall amount is employed to calibrate the soil hydraulic conductivity parameter of the {GA} model. The proposed procedure is evaluated by analysing 100 rainfall–runoff events that were observed in four small catchments of varying size. {CN}4GA appears to provide encouraging results for predicting the net rainfall peak and duration values and has shown, at least for the test cases considered in this study, better agreement with the observed hydrographs than the classic {SCS}-{CN} method.

Of late, Michel et al. (2005) reviewed the soil moisture accounting ({SMA}) procedure that lies behind the original {SCS}-{CN} method and pointed out severe structural inconsistencies in the treatment of antecedent condition and, in turn, proposed a sounder methodology. However, this method still needs refinement in the definition of initial moisture level (V0) to make it usable in field. Thus, in the present study, the Michel et al. (2005) model is modified to avoid the unrealistic sudden jump in V0 by incorporating conceptual {SMA} procedure and variation of daily {CN} based on antecedent moisture amount instead of antecedent moisture condition. When applied to 17 watersheds from different agro-climatic regions of India, the proposed model simulates daily stream flows better than those due to Michel et al. model. The proposed model performed better in high run-off producing (wet) watersheds than in low run-off producing (dry) watersheds, and the base flow was more and less significant in high and low run-off producing watersheds, respectively, whereas the evapotranspiration showed a reverse trend.

A five-parameter M3 model is proposed, with storm duration and a new parameter Sabs (potential maximum retention), to overcome most of the above limitations prevailing in the {SCS}-{CN} model. For simplicity and practical applications obviating storm-duration data, a four-parameter M4 model is also proposed. The performance of the suggested and the available models has been evaluated using the data of 82 small watersheds in the United States of America. As demonstrated, the M3 model performs the best, whereas the conventional {SCS}-{CN} model performs the poorest among all the models studied.},

The hydrologic soil groups ({HSG}) were determined from either direct {USDA} assignment or textural properties and compared with the {HSGs} required by the {CNs} and the cover condition. This study showed a standard error of about one {HSG}, resulting in an error in {CN} of approximately seven units when using the best-available data.

To this end, remote sensing ({RS}) satellite digital data from 1989 and 2000 were used for land use and land cover classification using a maximum likelihood classifier algorithm of supervised classification for {CN}-generation. Runoff was estimated for each grid by using a distributed-{CN} approach and averaged for the whole watershed by using a weighted-runoff approach. The estimated runoff values were compared with those from the traditional composite-{CN} technique. In both cases of initial abstraction (Ia) taken as 0.2 S and 0.3 S (where S is the potential maximum retention), the estimated runoff caused by distributed {CN} technique was more than that caused by the composite-{CN} approach. The difference in runoff values was more for Ia=0.3S than that for Ia=0.2S; runoff caused by distributed {CN} with Ia=0.2S matched more closely with the observed. Furthermore, the difference was very high for small events, moderate for medium, and low for high rainfall events; it was very high for the watershed exhibiting greater {CN} variation.},

	abstract = {{AbstractA} hybrid technique was used for the runoff production and its routing in an agro-forested watershed located within the Kanha National Park in Central India with the use of remote sensing and geographic information system ({GIS}) data. In this technique, a modified Soil Conservation Service curve number ({SCS}-{CN}) method and a two-dimensional overland flow model were combined. Modified {SCS}-{CN} method estimated daily net rainfall fractions were used as an input to the overland flow model along with other remote-sensing-derived inputs such as the digital elevation model ({DEM}), rainfall, and roughness factor for routing of the produced runoff. The model works on a cell basis and routs produced runoff from one cell to next following the maximum downslope directions. The flow model uses the diffusive wave approximations of the St. Venant equations for routing surface water. The model was tested by calibrating the Strickler coefficient K, which is inversely proportional to resistance to flow, and comparing the observed and simulated daily change in the water levels for two gauging sites. The calibrated average values of K for different subcatchments were 15.7, 21.7, 23.4, and 28.4 for Kurkuti, Sijhora, between the gauging sites, and downstream catchments, respectively. The model was tested for some statistical parameters like the Nash Sutcliffe coefficientand {RMSE} using residuals between observed and simulated data, and found to be within the acceptable limits. The results show that the hybrid technique works well to extend the application of curve number to address the routing phase of runoff.},

Despite this, its applications in water quality modeling have been very limited. For the first time, the present work explores the potential of the {SCS}-{CN} approach in water quality modeling of the river bank filtration process using a theoretical framework. The approach relates the curve number ({CN}) with the filtration/kinetic coefficient and the input applied to the system. The approach is tested for its effectiveness using the field data collected at the river bank filtration site at Haridwar, India. The {CN} is found to be dependent on travel time between source water and the abstraction well in addition to the influent concentration. For very low or very high values of influent concentration, the curve number exhibits an asymptotic variation approaching 100 and 0, respectively. Using the data on source water quality and the travel time, it is possible to compute the curve number and, subsequently, the filtrate quality at an abstraction well.},

The most critical assumption of the {SCS} method is that the ratio of actual retention to potential retention is the same as the ratio of actual runoff to potential runoff; however, this assumption has not been empirically validated. The paper develops a framework to test this proportionality assumption that underpins the {SCS} method. Using data on rainfall intensity and storm runoff from 210 site events from Australia and Southeast Asian countries, this paper shows that a strong relationship exists between maximum retention on the basis of the {SCS} equation and the product of effective storm duration and spatially averaged maximum infiltration rate, and empirical support exists for the proportionality assumption for runoff estimation. Relating the maximum retention to the effective storm duration and maximum infiltration rate provides additional avenues for prediction of storm runoff amount and peak runoff rate, which are the key design parameters for storm water control and management.},

	abstract = {{AbstractRadar}-derived next generation weather radar ({NEXRAD}) process 3 (P3) data offer high spatial resolution precipitation data that might improve stream-flow simulation accuracy using watershed models. The objective of this study was to assess the performance of spatially averaged subwatershed-specific P3 data on stream-flow simulations by using the soil and water assessment tool ({SWAT}) hydrologic model. This study was the first to evaluate the P3 product in watershed modeling. The {SWAT} model was chosen to simulate hydrological processes in North Fork Ninnescah Watershed (2,400 km2) located in south central Kansas. A precipitation gauge ({PG}) station was created for each subwatershed by using an area-weighted average of P3 precipitation estimates for all 16-km2 grid cells intersecting the subwatershed. Average subwatershed area (19 km2) was selected to correspond roughly with {NEXRAD} cell area to minimize spatial aggregation of radar precipitation data. The {SWAT} model was calibrated with both P3 data and {PG} data from January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2008. The P3-calibrated model was validated by using both different precipitation source data for the same simulation period (2002–2008) and the same source data with an independent simulation period (1996–2001). The {PG}-calibrated model yielded slightly higher Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency ({ENS}), both daily (0.40) and monthly (0.60), than the P3-calibrated model (daily: 0.35, monthly: 0.52); percent bias was very good ({\textless}±2\%) for both P3- and {PG}-calibrated models at all time scales. Validation {ENS} results, however, were diminished using {PG} data with the P3-calibrated model (daily: 0.27, monthly: 0.52) but remained similar using P3 data with the {PG}-calibrated model (daily: 0.40, monthly: 0.52). The {PG} data appeared to demonstrate variable uncertainty among stations that was not evident for the P3 data, providing incentive for the use of P3 data. This study found evidence that the {SWAT} model, when run using more spatially representative precipitation data (in this case, P3), was less sensitive to minor variations in model calibration parameters. On the basis of this initial assessment of P3 data for hydrologic modeling, bias adjustment to reduce the effect of a small number of extreme P3 precipitation values may have improved results but was not required to produce watershed-outlet stream flow results similar to using {PG} data in this study.},

	abstract = {{AbstractThe} Natural Resources Conservation Service ({NRCS}) [previously Soil Conservation Service ({SCS})] developed the {SCS} runoff curve-number ({CN}) method for estimating direct runoff from storm rainfall. The {NRCS} uses the {CN} method for designing structures and for evaluating their effectiveness. Structural design is usually based on a single event of a certain probability of occurrence. During the years when many floodwater-retarding watershed projects were planned and constructed (1950–1980), the {CN} equation was used in a continuous mode to evaluate the projects. To operate {CN} in a continuous mode, runoff was estimated from a daily rainfall record of approximately 30 years. For each day of recorded rainfall, the five-day antecedent rainfall was used to assign a {CN}1 (dry condition), {CN}2 (average condition), or {CN}3 (wet condition), and runoff was estimated with the appropriate {CN}. With the development of continuous hydrologic simulation models, {CN} was related directly to soil water content or estimated using rainfall and potential evapotranspiration ({PET}) to drive an index. Several methods were attempted and used with different degrees of success over a period of many years. The purpose of this study is to describe the evolution of the continuous {CN} method and its recent developments. Test results on the basis of the direct-link soil-moisture approach and the revised soil-moisture index method are presented for demonstration purposes. The results indicate that the revised soil-moisture index method is robust and produces realistic runoff estimates over a wide range of soil properties.},

A five-parameter M3 model is proposed, with storm duration and a new parameter Sabs (potential maximum retention), to overcome most of the above limitations prevailing in the {SCS}-{CN} model. For simplicity and practical applications obviating storm-duration data, a four-parameter M4 model is also proposed. The performance of the suggested and the available models has been evaluated using the data of 82 small watersheds in the United States of America. As demonstrated, the M3 model performs the best, whereas the conventional {SCS}-{CN} model performs the poorest among all the models studied.},

	abstract = {{AbstractEngineers} and hydrologists use the curve number method to estimate runoff from rainfall for different land use and soil conditions; however, large uncertainties occur for estimates from forested watersheds. This investigation evaluates the accuracy and consistency of the method using rainfall-runoff series from 10 small forested-mountainous watersheds in the eastern United States, eight annual maximum series from New Hampshire, West Virginia, and North Carolina, and two partial duration series from Georgia. These series are the basis to compare tabulated curve numbers with values estimated using five methods. For nine of 10 watersheds, tabulated curve numbers do not accurately estimate runoff. One source of the large uncertainty is a consistent decrease in storm-event curve numbers with increasing rainfall. A calibrated constant curve number is suitable for only two of 10 watersheds; the others require a variable watershed curve number associated with different magnitude rainfalls or probabilities of occurrence. Paired watersheds provide consistent curve numbers, indicating that regional values for forested-mountainous watersheds (locally calibrated and adjusted for storm frequency) may be feasible.},

	abstract = {Parkinson's disease ({PD}) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by two major neuropathological hallmarks: the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra ({SN}) and the presence of Lewy bodies in the surviving {SN} neurons, as well as other regions of the central and peripheral nervous system. Animal models have been invaluable tools for investigating the underlying mechanisms of the pathogenesis of {PD} and testing new potential symptomatic, neuroprotective and neurorestorative therapies. However, the usefulness of these models is dependent on how precisely they replicate the features of clinical {PD} with some studies now employing combined gene–environment models to replicate more of the affected pathways. The rotenone model of {PD} has become of great interest following the seminal paper by the Greenamyre group in 2000 (Betarbet et al., 2000). This paper reported for the first time that systemic rotenone was able to reproduce the two pathological hallmarks of {PD} as well as certain parkinsonian motor deficits. Since 2000, many research groups have actively used the rotenone model worldwide. This paper will review rotenone models, focusing upon their ability to reproduce the two pathological hallmarks of {PD}, motor deficits, extranigral pathology and non-motor symptoms. We will also summarize the recent advances in neuroprotective therapies, focusing on those that investigated non-motor symptoms and review rotenone models used in combination with {PD} genetic models to investigate gene–environment interactions.},

The decline could cause serious damage to the watershed. To evaluate possible changes in conditions in the Hilo area since the decline began, stream flow, water quality, and precipitation data from 1929 to 1980 were collected and analyzed. The limited data available do not indicate that the ohia decline has resulted in a significant change in either annual stream flow or peak stream flow of a stream discharging from the ohia forest in the Hilo area. Suspended sediment production of two streams remains well within accepted levels as does the chemical makeup of components dissolved in the streams.},

	abstract = {The effect of non-native trees on hydrological processes in Hawaiian forests remains largely unquantified. In this study, throughfall was determined by stationary methods over 18–23-month study periods at three locations each dominated by one of three non-native tree species including Schinus terebinthifolius, Coffea arabica, and Psidium cattleianum. The lowest mean throughfall percentage of 44\% occurred under a monotypic stand of P. cattleianum. Mean throughfall under canopies dominated by C. arabica and S. terebinthifolius were 59 and 60\%, respectively. Annualized throughfall rates were computed as 62, 60, and 45\% under canopies dominated by S. terebinthifolius, C. arabica, and P. cattleianum, respectively. The low mean throughfall at each location is likely due to high wet-canopy evaporation combined with frequent low-intensity/low magnitude rainfall. The exceptionally low throughfall under P. cattleianum may be the result of larger amounts of intercepted rainfall being diverted to stemflow and/or trunk storage. Observations suggest that stemflow is a substantial component of the canopy water balance in stands of P. cattleianum. Plant area index ({PAI}) was the lowest (3.66) under P. cattleianum and highest (4.64) under C. arabica. Mean direct throughfall coefficient p was computed from individual storm events at each location and ranged from a low of 0.16 under the canopy dominated by P. cattleianum to a high of 0.31 under the canopy dominated by S. terebinthifolius. A similarly computed mean canopy storage capacity S varied from 2.5 mm under primarily S. terebinthifolius to 4.0 mm at the location dominated by C. arabica.},

	abstract = {Evaporation of citrus orchards has been widely studied, but differences in methodologies and management conditions have led to conflicting results, mainly due to differences in ground cover and soil evaporation. In this work the contribution of transpiration and soil evaporation has been studied in a drip-irrigated, clean cultivated mandarin (Citrus reticulata Blanco) orchard on a sandy soil in Southern Spain. Evapotranspiration ({ET}) was measured using eddy covariance while soil evaporation was determined with microlysimeters, during August 2000 and May 2001. Average {ET} was 2.6 mm day−1 in August and 2.1 mm day−1 in May. The crop coefficient (Kc) was 0.44 and 0.43 in 2000 and 2001, respectively. The coefficient of transpiration (Kp) was 0.30 in 2000 and 0.25 in 2001. The daily bulk canopy conductance (gc) ranged from 1.2 to 2.2 (average 1.8) mm s−1 in 2000 and from 1.2 to 2.7 (average 1.9) mm s−1 in 2001. A model of daily canopy conductance as a function of intercepted radiation was derived and applied to calculate the transpiration of orchards with different values of ground cover ({GC}). The ratio of transpiration over reference {ET} of mandarin orchards is linearly related to ground cover (Kp = 0.7 {GC}). Calculated crop coefficients agree with values suggested by {FAO} for mature orchards (around 0.65) but are substantially lower than {FAO} values for young plantations.},

Additionally, tunnels and ditches of an extensive irrigation network directly intercept at least 10 million gallons per day of ground water.

This review summarizes procedures and examines new approaches for extraction, isolation, identification and quantification of individual congeners/isomers of the {PCBs} and {OCPs}. Critical to the successful application of this methodology is the collection, preparation, and storage of samples, as well as specific quality control and reporting criteria, and therefore these are also discussed. With the signing of the Stockholm convention on {POPs} and the development of global monitoring programs, there is an increased need for laboratories in developing countries to determine {PCBs} and {OCPs}. Thus, while this review attempts to summarize the current best practices for analysis of {PCBs} and {OCPs}, a major focus is the need for low-cost methods that can be easily implemented in developing countries. A “performance based” process is described whereby individual laboratories can adapt methods best suited to their situations. Access to modern capillary gas chromatography ({GC}) equipment with either electron capture or low-resolution mass spectrometry ({MS}) detection to separate and quantify {OCP}/{PCBs} is essential. However, screening of samples, especially in areas of known use of {OCPs} or {PCBs}, could be accomplished with bioanalytical methods such as specific commercially available enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assays and thus this topic is also reviewed. New analytical techniques such two-dimensional {GC} (2D-{GC}) and “fast {GC}” using {GC}–{ECD} may be well-suited for broader use in routine {PCB}/{OCP} analysis in the near future given their relatively low costs and ability to provide high-resolution separations of {PCB}/{OCPs}. Procedures with low environmental impact ({SPME}, microscale, low solvent use, etc.) are increasingly being used and may be particularly suited to developing countries.},

	abstract = {Rainfall interception loss of forest is an important component of water balance in a forested ecosystem. The Gash analytical model has been widely used to estimate the forest interception loss at field scale. In this study, we proposed a simple model to estimate rainfall interception loss of heterogeneous forest at regional scale with several reasonable assumptions using remote sensing observations. The model is a modified Gash analytical model using easily measured parameters of forest structure from satellite data and extends the original Gash model from point-scale to the regional scale. Preliminary results, using remote sensing data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ({MODIS}) products, field measured rainfall data, and meteorological data of the Automatic Weather Station ({AWS}) over a picea crassifolia forest in the upper reaches of the Heihe River Basin in northwestern China, showed reasonable accuracy in estimating rainfall interception loss at both the Dayekou experimental site (R2 = 0.91, {RMSE} = 0.34 mm∙d −1) and the Pailugou experimental site (R2 = 0.82, {RMSE} = 0.6 mm∙d −1), compared with ground measurements based on per unit area of forest. The interception loss map of the study area was shown to be strongly heterogeneous. The modified model has robust physics and is insensitive to the input parameters, according to the sensitivity analysis using numerical simulations. The modified model appears to be stable and easy to be applied for operational estimation of interception loss over large areas.},

	abstract = {This paper outlines a new methodology to derive evaporation from satellite observations. The approach uses a variety of satellite-sensor products to estimate daily evaporation at a global scale, with a 0.25 degree spatial resolution. Central to this approach is the use of the Priestley and Taylor ({PT}) evaporation model. Because the {PT} equation is driven by net radiation, this strategy avoids the need to specify surface fields of variables, such as the surface conductance, which cannot be detected directly from space. Key distinguishing features are the use of microwave-derived soil moisture, land surface temperature and vegetation density, as well as the use of a detailed rainfall interception module. The modelled evaporation is validated against one year of eddy covariance measurements from 43 stations. The estimated annual totals correlate well with the stations' annual cumulative evaporation (R = 0.84, N = 43) and show a negligible bias (−1.5\%). The validation of the daily time series at each individual station shows good model performance in all vegetation types and climate conditions with an average correlation coefficient of R = 0.84, still lower than the R  = 0.91 found in the validation of the monthly time series. The first global map of annual evaporation developed through this methodology is also presented.},

	abstract = {Abstract A parameterization of land surface processes to be included in mesoscale and large-scale meteorological models is presented. The number of parameters has been reduced as much as possible, while attempting to preserve the representation of the physics which controls the energy and water budgets. We distinguish two main classes of parameters. The spatial distribution of primary parameters, i.e., the dominant types of soil and vegetation within each grid cell, can be specified from existing global datasets. The secondary parameters, describing the physical properties of each type of soil and vegetation, can be inferred from measurements or derived from numerical experiments. A single surface temperature is used to represent the surface energy balance of the land/cover system. The soil heat flux is linearly interpolated between its value over bare ground and a value of zero for complete shielding by the vegetation. The ground surface moisture equation includes the effect of gravity and the thermo-hydric coefficients of the equations have been either calculated or calibrated using textural dependent formulations. The calibration has been made using the results of a detailed soil model forced by prescribed atmospheric mean conditions. The results show that the coefficients of the surface soil moisture equation are greatly dependent upon the textural class of the soil, as well as upon its moisture content. The new scheme has been included in a one-dimensional model which allows a complete interaction between the surface and the atmosphere. Several simulations have been performed using data collected during {HAPEX}-{MOBILHY}. These first results show the ability of the parameterization to reproduce the components of the surface energy balance over a wide variety of surface conditions.},

Two solvent sequences, methanol-diethyl ether-water (sample) and methanol-acetone-water (sample), gave satisfactory blank levels without reducing the adsorption capacity. Separate studies of the adsorption, desorption and evaporation steps showed that for a great number of non-polar compounds with different functional groups the recovery was mainly limited by losses in the evaporation step. For polar compounds such as certain alcohols and phenols the adsorption efficiency was the most critical factor. Losses during the desorption step could be made negligible except for naphthalene and anthracene. A study of interaction effects between humic substances in the water sample and the low-molecular-weight compounds to be analysed by gas chromatography did not give any evidence of a decrease in recovery or increase in breakthrough for any of the surface-water samples. Comparisons with dichloromethane extraction and stripping enrichment showed that adsorption on {XAD}-2 can give blank levels and recoveries which are in some respects superior. Furthermore, the {XAD}-2 technique and dichloromethane extraction were less sensitive to interaction effects from humic substances and less sensitive than the stripping technique.},

	abstract = {Legacy soil maps typically consist of a tessellation of polygon soil map unit delineations where the map units consist of a defined assemblage of soil classes assumed to exist in more-or-less fixed proportions. There are several limitations in this kind of mapping approach that relate to the original intent of the soil survey, the effect of mapping scale, and the nature of soil polygon boundaries. Yet perhaps a more fundamental limitation is the fact that most of the time, the soil classes that comprise the soil map units are not mapped individually: in effect their spatial distributions are unknown beyond the qualitative indications given in the accompanying soil map unit report.

Spatial disaggregation of soil map units attempts to map the spatial distribution of the individual soil classes that comprise a legacy soil map. We developed an approach called “Disaggregation and Harmonisation of Soil Map Units Through Resampled Classification Trees” ({DSMART}). {DSMART} samples the polygons of a legacy soil map and uses classification trees to generate a number of realisations of the potential soil class distribution. The realisations are then used to estimate the probability of occurrence of the individual soil classes. These estimates are mapped as raster grids, which can overcome some of the limitations of mapping scale and polygon boundaries inherent in the original legacy soil map.

We demonstrate the {DSMART} approach on a legacy soil map from the former Dalrymple Shire in central Queensland, Australia. We mapped the estimated probability of occurrence of the 71 soil classes in the legacy soil map, as well as the most probable soil class, second-most-probable soil class and the degree of confusion between them as determined by a confusion index. Validation on 285 observed soil profiles indicated that for 48.4\% of the validation profiles, the observed soil class was identified in the top three most probable soil classes.},

	abstract = {The objective of the work presented in this paper was to investigate how rasters of the probabilities of occurrence of soil classes may be used to create digital soil property maps and maps of their associated uncertainties. The approach we present is formalised in an algorithm we developed called “Digital Soil Property Mapping Using Soil Class Probability Rasters” ({PROPR}).

The soil class probability rasters were derived previously from a spatial disaggregation of the 1:250,000-scale Dalrymple Shire legacy soil polygon map from central Queensland, Australia.

We created digital soil property maps of soil {pH} 1:5 H2O and their uncertainties (as indicated by estimates of the limits of the 90\% prediction interval) at six depth increments down the soil profile (0–5 cm, 5–15 cm, 15–30 cm, 30–60 cm, 60–100 cm, 100–200 cm). The calculation of the weighted mean soil {pH} value for each depth increment at each grid cell was based on reference {pH} values for each soil class and used the probabilities of occurrence at each grid cell as weights.

The calculation of the prediction interval limits for each depth increment involved sampling from the triangular distribution of the soil {pH} of each soil class using the soil class probabilities at each grid cell as weights in order to identify the number of samples to draw from each distribution. The 90\% prediction interval limits were then estimated as the 5th and 95th percentiles of the distribution of samples drawn from the soil classes' triangular distributions.

The maps of soil {pH} displayed strong spatial patterns. Soil {pH} generally increased with depth. Uncertainty generally increased with depth. Validation on 300 randomly-selected soil profiles returned a Lin's concordance correlation coefficient of 0.193 at the surface increasing to 0.266 at depth. {RMSE} increased with depth from about 0.75 {pH} units at the surface to 1.15 at depth.

Soil class probability rasters are useful for generating digital soil property maps and maps of the associated uncertainties. Validation left room for improvement but the quality of the results is probably strongly affected by the quality of the spatial disaggregation that produced the soil class probability rasters. The {PROPR} approach may be useful in situations where profile observations are limiting but where legacy soil maps are available.

Generation of the soil class probability rasters to use in {PROPR} is a predictive exercise in itself and so is also subject to uncertainty. The probability rasters likely can be derived by several methods including logistic regression and data mining; the probability rasters we used were derived via spatial disaggregation of a legacy soil polygon map.

{PROPR} may be useful in situations where profile observations are limiting but where legacy soil maps are available. The soil class probability rasters need to be produced separately. Information on the within-soil-class variability of the target soil property at each depth increment must be known in order to establish the triangular distributions for the uncertainty estimation.

{PROPR} may reduce reliance on having sufficient soil profile observations in areas where such data is limiting. We used available profile observations to estimate the within-soil-class variability in order to establish triangular distributions for the soil classes in our study area, but the information required to do so could also be derived from legacy reports or expert knowledge.},

Environmental studies conducted primarily in Europe, Japan and North America indicate that these chemicals are ubiquitous in sediment and biota. The levels of {PBDEs} seem to be increasing, and several trends, including in humans, indicate that this increase may be rapid. The occurrence of high concentrations of certain {PBDE} isomers may be sufficient to elicit adverse effects in some wildlife. There is also concern that levels could cause adverse effects in sensitive human populations such as young children, indigenous peoples, and fish consumers. However, our knowledge about these chemicals, their sources, environmental behavior, and toxicity is limited, making risk assessment difficult.

This paper is a review of physically-based rainfall interception modelling. Fifteen models were selected, representing distinct concepts of the interception process. Applications of these models to field data sets published before March 2008 are also analysed. We review the theoretical basis of the different models, and give an overview of the models’ characteristics. The review is designed to help with the decision on which model to apply to a specific data set. The most commonly applied models were found to be the original and sparse Gash models (69 cases) and the original and sparse Rutter models (42 cases). The remaining 11 models have received much less attention, but the contribution of the Mulder model should also be acknowledged. The review reveals the need for more modelling of deciduous forest, for progressively more sparse forest and for forest in regions with intensive storms and the consequent high rainfall rates. The present review also highlights drawbacks of previous model applications. Failure to validate models, the few comparative studies, and lack of consideration given to uncertainties in measurements and parameters are the most outstanding drawbacks. Finally, the uncertainties in model input data are rarely taken into account in rainfall interception modelling.},

The method is equally applicable to areas with and without snowcover. The determination of infiltration-capacity during the snow-melting periods is, however, the most difficult problem and the method is here applied to this case, using data for areas in the Allegheny Experimental Forest, with varying degrees of forest-cover density. For these areas the rate of snow-melting per degree-day of temperature excess above 32° decreased as the cover-density increased.},

The results give insight to the process of interception, provide information on the level of the interception storage of the test species and illustrate the importance of leaf area.

Two interception models were tested. The interception—drainage model gave unsatisfactory results. The modified exponential model proved adequate as long as the proportion of rainfall passing through the canopy could be estimated. This proportion was shown to be a function of leaf area index. The use of this model together with a proposed simplified system is discussed with the view of characterizing an ungauged plant community in which elaborate interception studies have not been undertaken.},

Interception loss is that portion of the precipitation which is returned to the atmosphere through evaporation from plant surfaces or is absorbed into the plant. Thus, it is the difference between the precipitation actually occurring over an area and that which reaches the ground. Horton [1919] presented the first comprehensive discussion of the interception process and summarized data collected by himself as well as data published by others. He observed that interception loss was the sum of (1) the stored on the plant surfaces at the end of a storm (and subsequently returned to the atmosphere by evaporation) and (2) the evaporation from wet plant surfaces during a storm.},

	abstract = {Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov ({JFNK}) methods are synergistic combinations of Newton-type methods for superlinearly convergent solution of nonlinear equations and Krylov subspace methods for solving the Newton correction equations. The link between the two methods is the Jacobian-vector product, which may be probed approximately without forming and storing the elements of the true Jacobian, through a variety of means. Various approximations to the Jacobian matrix may still be required for preconditioning the resulting Krylov iteration. As with Krylov methods for linear problems, successful application of the {JFNK} method to any given problem is dependent on adequate preconditioning. {JFNK} has potential for application throughout problems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations and integro-differential equations. In this survey paper, we place {JFNK} in context with other nonlinear solution algorithms for both boundary value problems ({BVPs}) and initial value problems ({IVPs}). We provide an overview of the mechanics of {JFNK} and attempt to illustrate the wide variety of preconditioning options available. It is emphasized that {JFNK} can be wrapped (as an accelerator) around another nonlinear fixed point method (interpreted as a preconditioning process, potentially with significant code reuse). The aim of this paper is not to trace fully the evolution of {JFNK}, nor to provide proofs of accuracy or optimal convergence for all of the constituent methods, but rather to present the reader with a perspective on how {JFNK} may be applicable to applications of interest and to provide sources of further practical information.},

	abstract = {{PRO}-{GRADE} is an {ESRI} {ArcGIS} 9.2 plug-in package that consists of two separate toolkits: (1) the pattern recognition organizer for geographic information system ({PRO}-{GIS}) and (2) the ground water recharge and discharge estimator for {GIS} ({GRADE}-{GIS}). {PRO}-{GIS} is a collection of several existing image-processing algorithms into one user interface to offer the flexibility to extract spatial patterns according to the user’s needs. {GRADE}-{GIS} is a ground water recharge and discharge estimation interface using a mass balance method that requires only hydraulic conductivity, water table, and bedrock elevation data for simulating two-dimensional steady-state unconfined aquifers. {PRO}-{GRADE} was developed to assist ongoing assessments of the water resources in Illinois and Wisconsin, and is being used to assist several ground water resource studies in several locations in the United States. The advantage of using {PRO}-{GRADE} is to enable fast production of initial recharge and discharge maps that can be further enhanced by using a follow-up ground water flow model with parameter estimation codes. {PRO}-{GRADE} leverages {ArcGIS} to provide a computer-assisted framework to support expert judgment in order to efficiently select alternative recharge and discharge maps that can be used as (1) guidelines for field study planning and decision making; (2) initial conditions for numerical simulation; and (3) screening for alternative model selection and prediction/parameter uncertainty evaluation. In addition, {PRO}-{GRADE} allows for more easy and rapid correlation of those maps with other hydrologically relevant geospatial data.},

	abstract = {This article describes a {MODFLOW} Infiltration Device ({INFD}) Package that can simulate infiltration devices and their two-way interaction with groundwater. The {INFD} Package relies on a water balance including inflow of storm water, leakage-like seepage through the device faces, overflow, and change in storage. The water balance for the device can be simulated in multiple {INFD} time steps within a single {MODFLOW} time step, and infiltration from the device can be routed through the unsaturated zone to the groundwater table. A benchmark test shows that the {INFD} Package's analytical solution for stage computes exact results for transient behavior. To achieve similar accuracy by the numerical solution of the {MODFLOW} Surface-Water Routing ({SWR}1) Process requires many small time steps. Furthermore, the {INFD} Package includes an improved representation of flow through the {INFD} sides that results in lower infiltration rates than simulated by {SWR}1. The {INFD} Package is also demonstrated in a transient simulation of a hypothetical catchment where two devices interact differently with groundwater. This simulation demonstrates that device and groundwater interaction depends on the thickness of the unsaturated zone because a shallow groundwater table (a likely result from storm water infiltration itself) may occupy retention volume, whereas a thick unsaturated zone may cause a phase shift and a change of amplitude in groundwater table response to a change of infiltration. We thus find that the {INFD} Package accommodates the simulation of infiltration devices and groundwater in an integrated manner on small as well as large spatial and temporal scales.},

	abstract = {Abstract Although the global partitioning of evapotranspiration ({ET}) into transpiration, soil evaporation, and canopy evaporation is not well known, most current land surface schemes and the few available observations indicate that transpiration is the dominant component on the global scale, followed by soil evaporation and canopy evaporation. The Community Land Model version 3 ({CLM}3), however, does not reflect this global view of {ET} partitioning, with soil evaporation and canopy evaporation far outweighing transpiration. One consequence of this unrealistic {ET} partitioning in {CLM}3 is that photosynthesis, which is linked to transpiration through stomatal conductance, is significantly underestimated on a global basis. A number of modifications to {CLM}3 vegetation and soil hydrology parameterizations are described that improve {ET} partitioning and reduce an apparent dry soil bias in {CLM}3. The modifications reduce canopy interception and evaporation, reduce soil moisture stress on transpiration, increase transpiration through a more realistic canopy integration scheme, reduce within-canopy soil evaporation, eliminate lateral drainage of soil water, increase infiltration of water into the soil, and increase the vertical redistribution of soil water. The partitioning of {ET} is improved, with notable increases seen in transpiration (13\%–41\% of global {ET}) and photosynthesis (65–148 Pg C yr−1). Soils are wetter and exhibit a far more distinct soil moisture annual cycle and greater interseasonal soil water storage, which permits plants to sustain transpiration through the dry season. The broader influences of improved {ET} partitioning on land–atmosphere interaction are diverse. Stronger transpiration and reduced canopy evaporation yield an extended {ET} response to rain events and a shift in the precipitation distribution toward more frequent small- to medium-size rain events. Soil moisture memory time scales decrease particularly at deeper soil levels. Subsurface soil moisture exerts a slightly greater influence on precipitation. These results indicate that partitioning of {ET} is an important responsibility for land surface schemes, a responsibility that will gain in relevance as {GCMs} evolve to incorporate ever more complex treatments of the earth’s carbon and hydrologic cycles.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews the principles underlying water dynamics in the unsaturated zone and gives an overview of simulation modelling of soil water flow in the unsaturated zone.

The basic relations describing kinetics of flow and governing equations of flow in the unsaturated zone are presented in a general form considering unsteady multidimensional anisotropic and nonhomogeneous flow in the presence of sinks/sources. The influence of overburden potential, characterizing swelling soils, on water transport through the unsaturated zone is discussed. Outlines of thermally-induced water flow are presented with an extension to the specific case of frozen soils. Complex relationships describing the hydrological system are reduced into the one-dimensional vertical flow cases, for which the mathematical models are defined. The entire model has the form of a set of partial differential equations together with auxiliary conditions, that describe the system's geometry, parameters, boundary conditions and in case of transient flow also the initial conditions. Simulation is defined as operation with such a mathematical model.

Numerical approximations to solve governing equations of unsaturated water flow are emphasized. Recently-introduced numerical methods are discussed pointing out their advantages and limitations. Atmospheric boundary conditions of the modelled system are described with a maximizing procedure of the flux through the soil-air interface. Several options to define lower boundary conditions are discussed and a special type of lower boundary condition is given for the case that unsaturated flow is coupled with a regional groundwater model.

Simulation models require data concerning input, calibration and verification. The current status of collecting model parameters is discussed as well as measurement of common verification data, i.e. phreatic surface, matric head, water content and actual evapotranspiration.

Preferential flow of water through unsaturated soil has considerable consequences for simulating the field water balance. The attempts to simulate such hydrological systems are also evaluated.

Some transient flow problems are affected by hysteresis. Successful attempts to build hysteresis into dynamic simulation models are still scarce, though recently a number of solutions have been presented.

Finally, several practical examples of simulation of flow problems are presented. These examples are taken from everyday water management practice and document the wide range of applicability of simulation models.},

The models are individual-based vegetation simulators and compartment models of nutrient cycling and soil water relations. Applications focus on interactions and feedbacks between vegetation structure (species composition, size structure) and ecosystem processes (water balance, nutrient cycling), and how these relationships vary across environmental gradients. Preliminary results indicate that life-history traits of plants have a profound influence on system-level behaviors, and that differences between grasslands and forests can be attributed largely to contrasting traits of grasses and trees. Experiments with linked vegetation-ecosystem process models diverge from simulations with either model run independently, suggesting the importance of feedbacks between details of vegetation pattern and ecosystem processes. The development of a fully coupled vegetation-ecosystem process model that is sufficiently general to simulate systems dominated by multiple lifeforms presents several conceptual, logistical, and scaling challenges, but also provides for new opportunities in ecosystem theory.},

This model, which has evolved significantly both architecturally and functionally since its foundation, has been widely applied in over thirty interdisciplinary science investigations, and it is currently used as a learning resource for students in a number of educational institutes globally.

	abstract = {Whether or not the use of generalized, State Soil Geographic ({STATSGO}) data in place of higher resolution Soil Survey Geographic ({SSURGO}) data reduces the accuracy of hydrologic and nonpoint source pollution models has thus far been an open question. Comparative studies have yet to reveal a systematic bias in {STATSGO}–based model outputs on account of their small sample sizes and differences in the models employed. In an effort to determine whether a bias exists, direct runoff was modeled for a hypothetical 24-hour rainfall event, using {STATSGO} and {SSURGO} as alternative inputs to a series of standard rainfall-runoff models in nearly 300 contiguous watersheds, spanning most of the state of Wisconsin. The Long-Term Hydrologic Impact Assessment (L-{THIA}) modeling tool was used for this analysis. Results indicate that there is a negative bias in {STATSGO}–based runoff over the large majority of the study area and that the degree of underprediction is highest for spatially disaggregated (distributed parameter) models. Runoff was also modeled for daily precipitation in six gauged watersheds and was compared to observed runoff, with {SSURGO}–based, distributed models typically producing the most accurate outputs. In addition, a series of regression analyses was conducted to determine whether, and in what direction, the {STATSGO} bias is affected by the percent coverage of land uses that discourage infiltration. The results of these analyses suggest that {STATSGO}–based, lumped, and partially distributed models, on average, underpredict the relative impact of increasing land-use intensity. These findings indicate that two of the most common approaches to improving the computational efficiency of watershed modeling systems: the use of lower resolution soils data and the lumping of model parameters to larger spatial units of analysis, combine to reduce the accuracy of modeled runoff under current conditions, while simultaneously underestimating the impact of potential future land-use change.},

	abstract = {Continental-domain assessments of climate change impacts on water resources typically rely on statistically downscaled climate model outputs to force hydrologic models at a finer spatial resolution. This study examines the effects of four statistical downscaling methods [bias-corrected constructed analog ({BCCA}), bias-corrected spatial disaggregation applied at daily ({BCSDd}) and monthly scales ({BCSDm}), and asynchronous regression ({AR})] on retrospective hydrologic simulations using three hydrologic models with their default parameters (the Community Land Model, version 4.0; the Variable Infiltration Capacity model, version 4.1.2; and the Precipitation–Runoff Modeling System, version 3.0.4) over the contiguous United States ({CONUS}). Biases of hydrologic simulations forced by statistically downscaled climate data relative to the simulation with observation-based gridded data are presented. Each statistical downscaling method produces different meteorological portrayals including precipitation amount, wet-day frequency, and the energy input (i.e., shortwave radiation), and their interplay affects estimations of precipitation partitioning between evapotranspiration and runoff, extreme runoff, and hydrologic states (i.e., snow and soil moisture). The analyses show that {BCCA} underestimates annual precipitation by as much as −250 mm, leading to unreasonable hydrologic portrayals over the {CONUS} for all models. Although the other three statistical downscaling methods produce a comparable precipitation bias ranging from −10 to 8 mm across the {CONUS}, {BCSDd} severely overestimates the wet-day fraction by up to 0.25, leading to different precipitation partitioning compared to the simulations with other downscaled data. Overall, the choice of downscaling method contributes to less spread in runoff estimates (by a factor of 1.5–3) than the choice of hydrologic model with use of the default parameters if {BCCA} is excluded.},

	abstract = {A method is described for computing daily values of moisture stress on forest vegetation, or water deficits, based on the differences between Thornthwaite's potential evapo-transpiration and computed soil-moisture depletion. More realistic functions are used for soil-moisture depletion on specific soil types than have been customary. These functions related daily rates of depletion to characteristics of soil-moisture tension. Separate functions account for surface soil wetting and drying processes following rain and during dry periods. Two methods of summarizing the day-to-day distribution of moisture stress are illustrated. One utilizes directly accumulated stress values during such logical growth intervals as periods of leaf flushing or bud setting. In an example of a regression of red pine shoot growth on water deficits, 72\% of the variation in annual growth was accounted for by moisture stress during certain periods of both previous and current growing seasons. The second method computes moisture stress and weather variables as functions of time over two growing seasons and utilizes the coefficients of orthogonal polynomials as independent variables in regressions of growth. In an example of western white pine basal area growth utilizing this latter method, moisture stress accounted for a 28\% reduction in the variance of growth remaining after the effects of temperature and precipitation per se had been removed. The complete model accounted for 78\% of the total variation.},

A proposed irrigation project will provide a significant increase in crop production and will exert a large influence on the economics of Senegal, Mauritania, and Mali. The magnitude of benefits from the project will depend upon the allocation, scheduling and managing of that portion of the water to be used for irrigating agricultural crops. A procedure is recommended for estimating crop water requirements that only requires the measurement of maximum and minimum temperatures. This procedure although calibrated for the Senegal River Basin using climatic data from four representative locations appears to be generally applicable for other areas without calibration. The importance of rainfall in supplying part of crop water requirements is described. Mean, actual dependable and effective precipitation values are compared for one location. Block farming or the planting of a single crop to manageable areas should be made mandatory. Project managers must assume responsibility for implementing procedures to insure good productivity and reasonable efficiencies.},

	abstract = {A brief history of development of the 1985 Hargreaves equation and its comparison to evapotranspiration ({ET}) predicted by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations ({FAO}) Penman-Monteith method are described to provide background and information helpful in selecting an appropriate reference {ET} equation under various data situations. Early efforts in irrigation water requirement computations in California and other arid and semiarid regions required the development of simplified {ET} equations for use with limited weather data. Several initial efforts were directed towards improving the usefulness of pan evaporation for estimating irrigation water requirements. Similarity with climates of other countries allowed developments in California to be extended overseas. Criticism of empirical methods by H. L. Penman and others encouraged the search for a robust and practical method that was based on readily available climatic data for computing potential evapotranspiration or reference crop evapotranspiration ({ETo}). One of these efforts ultimately culminated in the 1985 Hargreaves {ETo} method. The 1985 Hargreaves {ETo} method requires only measured temperature data, is simple, and appears to be less impacted than Penman-type methods when data are collected from arid or semiarid, nonirrigated sites. For irrigated sites, the Hargreaves 1985 {ETo} method produces values for periods of five or more days that compare favorably with those of the {FAO} Penman-Monteith and California Irrigation Management Information Services ({CIMIS}) Penman methods. The Hargreaves {ETo} predicted 0.97 of lysimeter measured {ETo} at Kimberly, Idaho after adjustment of lysimeter data for differences in surface conductance from the {FAO} Penman-Monteith definition. Monthly {ETo} by the 1985 Hargreaves equation compares closely with {ETo} calculated using a simplified, “reduced-set” Penman-Monteith that requires air temperature data only.},

The objective of this study is to evaluate {ET}0 estimated by these equations against the corresponding values estimated using the standardized {FAO}-56 Penman–Monteith ({PM}) equation. For each location, {ET}0 estimates by the all equations were statistically compared with {FAO}-56 {PM} {ET}0 estimates. The Turc equation yielded the smallest root-mean-square-difference ({RMSD}) values at the all locations except Novi Sad, Serbia. The final ranking of equations was based on the weighted {RMSD}. The Turc equation has the lowest weighted {RMSD} and ranking first, and other equations ranked in decreasing order are: Priestley–Taylor, Jensen–Haise, Thornthwaite, and Hargreaves. The Turc equation gives the reliable calculation at all humid locations and it has proven to be the most adjustable to the local climatic conditions. The results obtained from this study, indicate very clearly that the Turc equation is most suitable for estimating reference evapotranspiration at humid locations when weather data are insufficient to apply the {FAO}-56 {PM} equation.},

Calculations were performed for both grass and alfalfa reference crops in a consistent manner, using weather data that passed integrity and quality assessment checks. Comparisons were made between reference {ET} computed by the various methods and the {ASCE} Penman-Monteith ({PM}) equation used for a daily calculation time step. In addition, calculations using hourly time steps and summed daily were compared with daily calculations for the same method as well as against the {ASCE}-{PM} method. Results showed that the {ASCE} standardized equation agreed best with the full form of {ASCE}-{PM}. The results provide a basis for objectively assessing the relative performance of reference {ET} equations in a variety of climates and support adoption of a standardized equation as recommended by the {ASCE} Task Committee.},

	abstract = {Two equations for estimating grass reference evapotranspiration ({ET}0) were derived using the Food and Agriculture Organization Penman–Monteith ({FAO}56-{PM}) method as an index. The first equation, solar radiation (Rs) based, estimates {ET}0 from incoming Rs and maximum and minimum air temperature, and the second equation, net radiation (Rn) based, uses Rn and maximum and minimum air temperature. The equations were derived using 15 years (1980–1994) of daily {ET}0 values estimated from the {FAO}56-{PM} method using the measured and carefully screened weather data from near Gainesville, Florida. The performance of the derived equations was evaluated for 6 validation years (1995–2000), including dry and wet years, for the same site and for other humid locations in the Southeast United States. Comparisons of the performance of the derived equations with the other commonly used methods indicated that they estimate {ET}0 as good or better than those other {ET}0 methods. The Rs- and Rn-based equations resulted in the lowest 6 year average standard error of estimate ({SEE}) of daily {ET}0 (0.44 and 0.41 mm day−1, respectively). Both equations performed quite well for estimating peak month {ET}0 and had the lowest 6 year average daily {SEE} for the peak month {ET}0 (0.24 mm day−1 for both equations). Estimates for annual total {ET}0 were very close to those obtained from the {FAO}56-{PM} method. The 6 year average ratio of {ET}0 method to {ET}0 {FAO}56-{PM} were 1.05 and 1.03 for the Rs- and Rn-based equations, respectively. The derived equations were further evaluated in other humid locations in the Southeast United States, including two locations in coastal regions in Florida, one location in Georgia, and another location in Alabama. The comparisons showed that both equations are likely to provide good estimates of {ET}0 in humid locations of the Southeast United States. When the required input variables are considered, the Priestley–Taylor ({PT}) method was the closest method to the second derived equation (Rn based). Therefore, it was necessary to evaluate how the {PT} method would perform compared to the Rn-based equation relative to the {FAO}56-{PM} method after it is calibrated locally. Although the performance of the {PT} method improved slightly after the calibration, its performances for estimating daily and peak month {ET}0 remained poorer than the Rn-based equation in all cases. Considering the limitations associated with the availability and reliability of the climatological data, especially in developing countries, the derived equations presented in this study are suggested as practical methods for estimating {ET}0 if the standard {FAO}56-{PM} equation cannot be used because of the above-mentioned limitations. These equations are recommended over the other commonly used simplified temperature and radiation-based methods evaluated in this study for humid climates in the Southeast United States.},

	abstract = {{RAQSIM}, a generalized flow model of a groundwater system using finite-element methods, is documented to explain how it works and to demonstrate that it gives valid results. Three support programs that are used to compute recharge and discharge data required as input to {RAQSIM} are described. {RAQSIM} was developed to solve transient, two-dimensional, regional groundwater flow problems with isotropic or anisotropic conductance. The model can also simulate radially-symmetric flow to a well and steady-state flow. The mathematical basis, program structure, data input and output procedures, organization of data sets, and program features and options of {RAQSIM} are discussed. An example , containing listings of data and results and illustrating {RAQSIM} 's capabilities, is discussed in detail. Two test problems also are discussed comparing {RAQSIM} 's results with analytical procedures. The first support program described, the {PET} Program, uses solar radiation and other climatic data in the Jensen-Haise method to compute potential evapotranspiration. The second support program, the Soil-Water Program, uses output from the {PET} Program, soil characteristics, and the ratio of potential to actual evapotranspiration for each crop to compute infiltration, storage, and removal of water from the soil zone. The third program, the Recharge-Discharge Program, uses output from the Soil-Water Program together with other data to compute recharge and discharge from the groundwater flow system. For each support program, a program listing and examples of the data and results for the Twin Platte-Middle Republican study are provided. In addition, a brief discussion on how each program operates and on procedures for running and modifying these programs are presented. (Author 's abstract)},

	url = {http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/wsp1811},
	abstract = {The Little Plover River basin is in the sand-plain area of central Wisconsin. The basin and the surrounding sand-plain area provide a good fish and wildlife habitat and is a popular locale for sport fishing. Good yields may be obtained in the area from irrigated crops, and the irrigated acreage has been increasing rapidly in recent years. Sportsmen and conservationists are concerned about the effects of increased development of the water resources on the streams as trout habitat. In the past, many political and legal conflicts among water users have arisen from erroneous opinions as to the behavior of water. Many of these conflicts would be diminished or eliminated if the participants were cognizant of fundamental hydrologic principles. This study was made to demonstrate the extent and nature of the interrelation of ground water and surface water and the fundamental hydrologic principles governing water movement. The study was also made to determine the hydrologic changes that might occur following development, to provide information that might be used as a basis for planning water development, and for drafting legislation that recognizes the relation between ground water and surface water. Water has been developed in the Little Plover River basin for industry, for domestic and stock supplies, and for irrigation. Irrigated acreage is increasing in the area, and the use of water for irrigation may alter the hydrology of the basin somewhat. About 4,000-4,500 acres of land within the basin, or 50-60 percent of the basin area, is suitable for irrigated farming, but probably no more than 2,500 acres will be under irrigation in any one year, unless present crop-rotation practices are changed. Most of the Little Plover River basin is underlain by from 40 to 100 feet of glacial outwash consisting of highly permeable sand and gravel. The glacial outwash is the main aquifer in the area and is capable of yielding large quantities of water to wells. An aquifer test in the area indicated that the coefficient of transmissibility of the glacial outwash is about 140,000 gallons per day per foot. The specific yield of the outwash is about 20 percent, as determined from water-level and streamfiow data. Morainal deposits occur locally with the glacial outwash. These deposits transmit water readily and do not form barriers to ground water in the outwash. Relatively impermeable crystalline rocks underlie the glacial deposits, and a sandstone ridge of low permeability impedes the movement of ground water from the basin by underflow. The glacial outwash and morainal deposits are recharged by infiltration of 9-10 inches of the 31 inches of precipitation that falls on the area in an average year.

	abstract = {Portage County has abundant resources of generally good quality water and, although water problems exist locally, depletion or general scarcity of water is not likely in the foreseeable future. The county receives annually about 31 inches of precipitation, of which about 21 inches is lost as evaportranspiration. The average annual water yield is about 10.6 inches and consists of about 10.3 inches of runoff to streams, about 0.2 inch of water which leaves the county as underflow, and about 0.1 inch of water which is used consumptively. The surface-water resources include 104 lakes, about 110 miles of streams that discharge about 600 cfs (cubic feet per second) to the Wisconsin, Waupaca, and Little Wolf Rivers, and the Wisconsin River which has an average flow of about 2.400 cfs. Extensive deposits of outwash sand and gravel, sandy till, and alluvium release annually about 460 cfs of ground water to the streams. The principal source of ground water is thick deposits of glacial drift that occur over all but the northwestern part of the county. Although as much as 100 feet of sandstone underlies the drift in the southern part, it is not an important aquifer. Impermeable crystalline rocks of Precambrian age underlie all the aquifers and limit the downward movement of water. The county has been divided into areas having similar geologic and hydrologic conditions. These areas are here named the "sand-plain province," the "drift province," and the "drift-crystalline-rock province." The sand-plain province and the eastern part of the drift province have the greatest potential for development of large ground-water supplies. Wells yielding 1,000 to 2,000 gpm (gallons per minute) can be developed in the sand-plain province and wells yielding about 500 gpm can be developed in the drift province. Nearly all the communities in the county have water resources adequate for future expansion. An exception to this is Junction City where only a limited supply of poor quality water is readily available. Additional supplies can be developed from ground water in the Mill Creek area or from the Wisconsin River. In the sand-plain and drift provinces, ground-water runoff is about 9 inches a year and surface runoff is about 1 inch a year and of short duration. In the drift-crystalline-rock province, however, ground-water runoff is about 2 inches a year and surface runoff is about 8 inches a year and varies greatly in rate of flow. Surface and ground water are closely interrelated throughout the county and constitute a single resource. Streams, lakes, and marshes are the visible part of the ground-water surface and ground water moves slowly and continuously toward these surface points of discharge. Pumping for irrigation has temporarily lowered water levels in the vicinity of wells but has not lowered regional water levels. Pumpage},

Journal of the American Water Resources Association ({JAWRA}) 1-14. {DOI}: 10.1111/jawr.12010 Abstract:  Evapotranspiration ({ET}) is an important quantity for water resource managers to know because it often represents the largest sink for precipitation (P) arriving at the land surface. In order to estimate actual {ET} across the conterminous United States (U.S.) in this study, a water-balance method was combined with a climate and land-cover regression equation. Precipitation and streamflow records were compiled for 838 watersheds for 1971-2000 across the U.S. to obtain long-term estimates of actual {ET}. A regression equation was developed that related the ratio {ET}/P to climate and land-cover variables within those watersheds. Precipitation and temperatures were used from the {PRISM} climate dataset, and land-cover data were used from the {USGS} National Land Cover Dataset. Results indicate that {ET} can be predicted relatively well at a watershed or county scale with readily available climate variables alone, and that land-cover data can also improve those predictions. Using the climate and land-cover data at an 800-m scale and then averaging to the county scale, maps were produced showing estimates of {ET} and {ET}/P for the entire conterminous U.S. Using the regression equation, such maps could also be made for more detailed state coverages, or for other areas of the world where climate and land-cover data are plentiful.},

	abstract = {Proliferation of evapotranspiration ({ET}) products warrants comparison of these products. The study objective was to assess uncertainty in {ET} output from four land surface models ({LSMs}), Noah, Mosaic, {VIC}, and {SAC} in {NLDAS}-2, two remote sensing-based products, {MODIS} and {AVHRR}, and {GRACE}-inferred {ET} from a water budget with precipitation from {PRISM}, monitored runoff, and total water storage change ({TWSC}) from {GRACE} satellites. The three cornered hat method, which does not require a priori knowledge of the true {ET} value, was used to estimate {ET} uncertainties. In addition, {TWSC} or total water storage anomaly ({TWSA}) from {GRACE} was compared with water budget estimates of {TWSC} from a flux-based approach or {TWSA} from a storage-based approach. The analyses were conducted using data from three regions (humid-arid) in the South Central United States as case studies. Uncertainties in {ET} are lowest in {LSM} {ET} (∼5 mm/mo), moderate in {MODIS} or {AVHRR}-based {ET} (10–15 mm/mo), and highest in {GRACE}-inferred {ET} (20–30 mm/month). There is a trade-off between spatial resolution and uncertainty, with lower uncertainty in the coarser-resolution {LSM} {ET} (∼14 km) relative to higher uncertainty in the finer-resolution (∼1–8 km) {RS} {ET}. Root-mean-square ({RMS}) of uncertainties in water budget estimates of {TWSC} is about half of {RMS} of uncertainties in {GRACE}-derived {TWSC} for each of the regions. Future {ET} estimation should consider a hybrid approach that integrates strengths of {LSMs} and satellite-based products to constrain uncertainties.},

Its application is, however, laborious and somewhat involved and there seems to be a reluctance toward using it on the part of some soil-technologists and others. This reluctance may not arise from a desire to avoid labor but from the fact that calculations of f by this method are of the nature of hydraulic or hydrologic calculations, and consequently unfamiliar. This unfamiliarity with fundamental physical and hydrologic laws and processes is revealed by the substitution in some cases of what is called an “(i - q )-curve,” which represents the result of subtracting surface-runoff intensities qs , as determined by infiltrometer-tests, from the corresponding rain-intensity i, and platting the results in terms of time. The resulting curve is sometimes labeled “infiltration-capacity”, which it is not. Whether so labeled or not, it is often used as if it was identical or sensibly identical with a true f-curve.},

Baseflow indices for 65 North American catchments are compared, which were calculated with seven different baseflow separation methods ({HYSEP}1, {HYSEP}2, {HYSEP}3, {PART}, {BFLOW}, {UKIH}, and Eckhardt). Since the true values of the baseflow index are unknown, it cannot be said, which one of the methods gives the best estimates. However, the results of the Eckhardt method appear to be hydrologically more plausible than those of the other algorithms. Furthermore, this algorithm can be applied to hydrographs of any time step length. A simple technique for assessing the recession constant – one of the parameters of the algorithm – is presented.},

	abstract = {It is well established that wet environment potential evapotranspiration ({PET}) can be reliably estimated using the energy budget at the canopy or land surface. However, in most cases the necessary radiation measurements are not available and, thus, empirical temperature-based {PET} models are still widely used, especially in watershed models. Here we question the presumption that empirical {PET} models require fewer input data than more physically based models. Specifically, we test whether the energy-budget-based Priestley-Taylor (P-T) model can reliably predict daily {PET} using primarily air temperature to estimate the radiation fluxes and associated parameters. This method of calculating {PET} requires only daily minimum and maximum temperature, day of the year, and latitude. We compared {PET} estimates using directly measured radiation fluxes to {PET} calculated from temperature-based radiation estimates at four humid {AmeriFlux} sites. We found good agreement between P-T {PET} calculated from measured radiation fluxes and P-T {PET} determined via air temperature. In addition, in three of the four sites, the temperature-based radiation approximations had a stronger correlation with measured evapotranspiration ({ET}) during periods of maximal {ET} than fully empirical Hargreaves, Hamon and Oudin methods. Of the three fully empirical models, the Hargreaves performed the best. Overall, the results suggest that daily {PET} estimates can be made using a physically based approach even when radiation measurements are unavailable.},

Validation of the resulting gridded surface meteorological data, using an extensive network of automated weather stations across the western United States, showed skill comparable to that derived from interpolation using station observations, suggesting it can serve as suitable surrogate for landscape-scale ecological modelling across vast unmonitored areas of the United States.

	abstract = {Hydrologic models often are applied to adjust projections of hydroclimatic change that come from climate models. Such adjustment includes climate-bias correction, spatial refinement (“downscaling”), and consideration of the roles of hydrologic processes that were neglected in the climate model. Described herein is a quantitative analysis of the effects of hydrologic adjustment on the projections of runoff change associated with projected twenty-first-century climate change. In a case study including three climate models and 10 river basins in the contiguous United States, the authors find that relative (i.e., fractional or percentage) runoff change computed with hydrologic adjustment more often than not was less positive (or, equivalently, more negative) than what was projected by the climate models. The dominant contributor to this decrease in runoff was a ubiquitous change in runoff (median −11\%) caused by the hydrologic model’s apparent amplification of the climate-model-implied growth in potential evapotranspiration. Analysis suggests that the hydrologic model, on the basis of the empirical, temperature-based modified Jensen–Haise formula, calculates a change in potential evapotranspiration that is typically 3 times the change implied by the climate models, which explicitly track surface energy budgets. In comparison with the amplification of potential evapotranspiration, central tendencies of other contributions from hydrologic adjustment (spatial refinement, climate-bias adjustment, and process refinement) were relatively small. The authors’ findings highlight the need for caution when projecting changes in potential evapotranspiration for use in hydrologic models or drought indices to evaluate climate-change impacts on water.},

On many major rivers, infrequent sampling of most pollutants makes these estimates difficult. However, most large rivers have complete daily flow records available from the U.S. Geological Survey. A number of different estimation methods have been developed to use these data in conjunction with available concentration data to calculate pollutant loadings. Several of these methods have been evaluated in this paper for a typical major tributary. Intensive measurements of pollutant loadings to Lake Michigan from the Grand River in 1976–1977 were conducted by {USEPA}, Region V. Daily concentrations of several chemical parameters, including total phosphorus, were determined. This information, together with daily river flow rates from {USGS}, provide an excellent data set for testing various load estimation methods. Ten different methods were tested using 680 randomly generated 25-sample subsets of the daily total phosphorus data set. The methods tested included several simple calculation schemes, as well as flowconcentration correlations and the stratified ratio estimator. The latter method is shown to be at least slightly better than the others for these data and for this type of sampling, including when sampling is concentrated during periods of high flow.},

	abstract = {The assessment of climate change impacts on water resources involves several methodological decisions, including choices of global climate models ({GCMs}), emission scenarios, downscaling techniques, and hydrologic modeling approaches. Among these, hydrologic model structure selection and parameter calibration are particularly relevant and usually have a strong subjective component. The goal of this research is to improve understanding of the role of these decisions on the assessment of the effects of climate change on hydrologic processes. The study is conducted in three basins located in the Colorado headwaters region, using four different hydrologic model structures [{PRMS}, {VIC}, Noah {LSM}, and Noah {LSM} with multiparameterization options (Noah-{MP})]. To better understand the role of parameter estimation, model performance and projected hydrologic changes (i.e., changes in the hydrology obtained from hydrologic models due to climate change) are compared before and after calibration with the University of Arizona shuffled complex evolution ({SCE}-{UA}) algorithm. Hydrologic changes are examined via a climate change scenario where the Community Climate System Model ({CCSM}) change signal is used to perturb the boundary conditions of the Weather Research and Forecasting ({WRF}) Model configured at 4-km resolution. Substantial intermodel differences (i.e., discrepancies between hydrologic models) in the portrayal of climate change impacts on water resources are demonstrated. Specifically, intermodel differences are larger than the mean signal from the {CCSM}–{WRF} climate scenario examined, even after the calibration process. Importantly, traditional single-objective calibration techniques aimed to reduce errors in runoff simulations do not necessarily improve intermodel agreement (i.e., same outputs from different hydrologic models) in projected changes of some hydrological processes such as evapotranspiration or snowpack.},

	abstract = {Potential evapotranspiration ({PET}) is the water that would be lost by plants through evaporation and transpiration if water was not limited in the soil, and it is commonly used in conceptual hydrological modelling in the calculation of runoff production and hence river discharge. Future changes of {PET} are likely to be as important as changes in precipitation patterns in determining changes in river flows. However {PET} is not calculated routinely by climate models so it must be derived independently when the impact of climate change on river flow is to be assessed. This paper compares {PET} estimates from 12 equations of different complexity, driven by the Hadley Centre's {HadRM}3-Q0 model outputs representative of 1961–1990, with {MORECS} {PET}, a product used as reference {PET} in Great Britain. The results show that the {FAO}56 version of the Penman–Monteith equations reproduces best the spatial and seasonal variability of {MORECS} {PET} across {GB} when driven by {HadRM}3-Q0 estimates of relative humidity, total cloud, wind speed and linearly bias-corrected mean surface temperature. This suggests that potential biases in {HadRM}3-Q0 climate do not result in significant biases when the physically based {FAO}56 equations are used. Percentage changes in {PET} between the 1961–1990 and 2041–2070 time slices were also calculated for each of the 12 {PET} equations from {HadRM}3-Q0. Results show a large variation in the magnitude (and sometimes direction) of changes estimated from different {PET} equations, with Turc, Jensen–Haise and calibrated Blaney–Criddle methods systematically projecting the largest increases across {GB} for all months and Priestley–Taylor, Makkink, and Thornthwaite showing the smallest changes. We recommend the use of the {FAO}56 equation as, when driven by {HadRM}3-Q0 climate data, this best reproduces the reference {MORECS} {PET} across Great Britain for the reference period of 1961–1990. Further, the future changes of {PET} estimated by {FAO}56 are within the range of uncertainty defined by the ensemble of 12 {PET} equations. The changes show a clear northwest–southeast gradient of {PET} increase with largest (smallest) changes in the northwest in January (July and October) respectively. However, the range in magnitude of {PET} changes due to the choice of {PET} method shown in this study for Great Britain suggests that {PET} uncertainty is a challenge facing the assessment of climate change impact on hydrology mostly ignored up to now.},

	abstract = {Hydrologic impacts of climate change are regularly assessed with hydrologic models that use air temperature as a proxy to compute potential evapotranspiration ({PET}). This approach is taken in the Large Basin Runoff Model ({LBRM}), which has been used several times for calculation of the runoff from the terrestrial part of the Great Lakes basin under climate change scenarios, with the results widely cited. However, a balance between incoming and outgoing energy, including the latent heat of evaporation, is a fundamental requirement for a land surface, and is not enforced under this approach. For calculating {PET} and evapotranspiration ({ET}) in climate change scenarios, we use an energy budget-based approach to adjusting the {PET} as an alternative that better satisfies conservation of energy. Using this new method, the increase in {ET} under enhanced greenhouse gas concentrations has reduced magnitude compared to that projected using the air temperature proxy. This results in either a smaller decrease in net basin supply and smaller drop in lake levels than using the temperature proxy, or a reversal to increased net basin supply and higher lake levels. An additional reason not to rely on a temperature proxy relation is that observational evidence demonstrates that the correlation between air temperature and {ET} (or {PET}) is restricted to the mean annual cycle of these variables. This brings into question the validity of air temperature as a proxy for {PET} when considering non-annual variability and secular changes in the climate regime.},

	abstract = {Simulations of future climate change impacts on water resources are subject to multiple and cascading uncertainties associated with different modeling and methodological choices. A key facet of this uncertainty is the coarse spatial resolution of {GCM} output compared to the finer-resolution information needed by water managers. To address this issue, it is now common practice to apply spatial downscaling techniques, using either higher-resolution regional climate models or statistical approaches applied to {GCM} output, to develop finer-resolution information. Downscaling, however, can also introduce its own uncertainties into water resources’ impact assessments. This study uses watershed simulations in five U.S. basins to quantify the sources of variability in streamflow, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment loads associated with the underlying {GCM} compared to the choice of downscaling method (both statistically and dynamically downscaled {GCM} output). This study also assesses the specific, incremental effects of downscaling by comparing watershed simulations based on downscaled and nondownscaled {GCM} model output. Results show that the underlying {GCM} and the downscaling method each contribute to the variability of simulated watershed responses. The relative contribution of {GCM} and downscaling method to the variability of simulated responses varies by watershed and season of the year. Results illustrate the potential implications of one key methodological choice in conducting climate change impact assessments for water—the selection of downscaled climate change information.},

For the analysis, computed output from three hydrologic models was considered as the true watershed response. Variations in the form of random fluctuations and fixed biases were introduced into the potential evapotranspiration (Pet) input data of the test models. By leaving the other inputs and parameters unchanged, such an analysis shows the effect of evapotranspiration on streamflow under the regulation of the other components in the model. It is shown that a constant bias of 20\% in the Pet input data has a cumulative effect and results in considerable error in the computed hydrograph peaks and recession characteristics, whereas the influence of the random error on estimated streamflow was generally not measurable for the watersheds and models studied.},

	abstract = {We derive an analytic expression for the matric flux potential (M) for van Genuchten–Mualem ({VGM}) type soils which can also be written in terms of a converging infinite series. Considering the first four terms of this series, the accuracy of the approximation was verified by comparing it to values of M estimated by numerical finite difference integration. Using values of the parameters for three soils from different texture classes, the proposed four-term approximation showed an almost perfect match with the numerical solution, except for effective saturations higher than 0.9. Including more terms reduced the discrepancy but also increased the complexity of the equation. The four-term equation can be used for most applications. Cases with special interest in nearly saturated soils should include more terms from the infinite series. A transpiration reduction function for use with the {VGM} equations is derived by combining the derived expression for M with a root water extraction model. The shape of the resulting reduction function and its dependency on the derivative of the soil hydraulic diffusivity D with respect to the soil water content θ is discussed. Positive and negative values of {dD}/dθ yield concave and convex or S-shaped reduction functions, respectively. On the basis of three data sets, the hydraulic properties of virtually all soils yield concave reduction curves. Such curves based solely on soil hydraulic properties do not account for the complex interactions between shoot growth, root growth, and water availability.},

	abstract = {A new complete map of soil series probabilities has been produced for the contiguous United States at a 30 m spatial resolution. This innovative database, named {POLARIS}, is constructed using available high-resolution geospatial environmental data and a state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm ({DSMART}-{HPC}) to remap the Soil Survey Geographic ({SSURGO}) database. This 9 billion grid cell database is possible using available high performance computing resources. {POLARIS} provides a spatially continuous, internally consistent, quantitative prediction of soil series. It offers potential solutions to the primary weaknesses in {SSURGO}: 1) unmapped areas are gap-filled using survey data from the surrounding regions, 2) the artificial discontinuities at political boundaries are removed, and 3) the use of high resolution environmental covariate data leads to a spatial disaggregation of the coarse polygons. The geospatial environmental covariates that have the largest role in assembling {POLARIS} over the contiguous United States ({CONUS}) are fine-scale (30 m) elevation data and coarse-scale ({\textasciitilde} 2 km) estimates of the geographic distribution of uranium, thorium, and potassium. A preliminary validation of {POLARIS} using the {NRCS} National Soil Information System ({NASIS}) database shows variable performance over {CONUS}. In general, the best performance is obtained at grid cells where {DSMART}-{HPC} is most able to reduce the chance of misclassification. The important role of environmental covariates in limiting prediction uncertainty suggests including additional covariates is pivotal to improving {POLARIS}' accuracy. This database has the potential to improve the modeling of biogeochemical, water, and energy cycles in environmental models; enhance availability of data for precision agriculture; and assist hydrologic monitoring and forecasting to ensure food and water security.},

The State Soil Geographic Database ({STATSGO}) developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture–Natural Resources Conservation Service served as the starting point for {CONUS}-{SOIL}.

Interpolation procedures for the continuous and categorical variables describing these soil properties were developed and applied to the original {STATSGO} data.

The models include a regression model, a unit hydrograph model, and a quasi-physically based model. The catchments are from the Washita River Experimental Watershed, Oklahoma; the Mahantango Creek Experimental Watershed, Pennsylvania; and the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire. Model performance was assessed for a verification period that is carefully distinguished from the calibration period. Performance assessment was carried out both in forecasting mode and in prediction mode. The results show surprisingly poor forecasting efficiencies for all models on all data sets. The unit hydrograph model and the quasi-physically based model have little forecasting power; the regression model is marginally better. The performance of the models in prediction mode is better. The regression model and the unit hydrograph model showed acceptable predictive power, but the quasi-physically based model produced acceptable predictions on only one of the three catchments. We believe that the primary barrier to the successful application of physically based models in the field lies in the scale problems that are associated with the unmeasurable spatial variability of rainfall and soil hydraulic properties. The fact that simpler, less data intensive models provided as good or better predictions than a physically based model is food for thought.},

	abstract = {It has become popular with some hydrologists to consider runoff produced by rainfall intensities in excess of soil infiltration capacity (‘Horton’ excess) and runoff produced by rain falling on saturated soil zones (saturation excess) to be alternative or competitive models for describing surface runoff. On the contrary, we contend with Freeze (1972) that these two mechanisms, along with subsurface stormflow, are three parts of a continuum of hydrologic response that are controlled by the relative properties of the soil and the rainfall. We introduce a model which trades some of the generality of the Freeze (1972) hillslope model for increased efficiency, by selecting efficient approximations for key elements in hillslope hydrodynamics: infiltration and movement in the unsaturated flow zone. The hillslope is considered to consist of two soil layers with the lower soil capable of restricting vertical flow at the interface to create a perched aquifer and subsurface stormflow. The slope of the interface is arbitrary. A kinematic method for routing unsaturated vertical flow is described and is linked consistently with a modern analytically derived infiltration model, which operates when rainfall exceeds surface saturated hydraulic conductivity Ks. The model is used to demonstrate several of the relationships between rainfall flux, soil hydraulic properties, hillslope geometry, and runoff characteristics. The model is also applied to simulate experimental data from a hillslope in Western Australia. Subsurface stormflow recessions are demonstrated to be affected by the ratio Ks/ql, anisotropy, and spatial distribution of saturated hydraulic conductivity Ks, where ql is the rate of loss from the perched aquifer. Vertical growth of the saturated zone depth is demonstrated to have a potentially greater effect on runoff than horizontal movement in cases where anisotropy and/or slope is not severe.},

For this purpose, the mathematical expressions of three parameters for the Horton infiltration capacity curve were derived in terms of rainfall and runoff data, and the lag time of the effective rainfall in the unsaturated zone and the groundwater flow routing equation are also presented. With these equations, the baseflow hydrographs at the outlet of the basin can be separated. The flow chart of the proposed method for baseflow hydrograph separation is given. Three recent baseflow separation methods, i.e. digital filter, non-linear reservoir and the Boussinesq equation, were chosen as parallel schemes to compare with the proposed method. Rainfall-runoff data from four watersheds located in different climatic regions in China were selected and used as case studies. Test and application results indicate that the proposed baseflow hydrograph separation method is in accordance with the hydrological physical process. The proposed method is comparable with current available methods and reduces some of the subjective aspects for the rising limb of the baseflow hydrograph, and it is useful for unit hydrograph analysis and for the study of the rainfall-runoff relationship.

	abstract = {Summary
Estimation of baseflow and groundwater recharge rates is important for hydrological analysis and modelling. A new approach which combines recursive digital filter ({RDF}) model with conductivity mass balance ({CMB}) method was considered to be reliable for baseflow separation because the combined method takes advantages of the reduced data requirement for {RDF} method and the reliability of {CMB} method. However, it is not clear what the minimum data requirements for producing acceptable estimates of the {RDF} model parameters are. In this study, 19-year record of stream discharge and water conductivity collected from the Black Brook Watershed ({BBW}), {NB}, Canada were used to test the combined baseflow separation method and assess the variability of parameters in the model over seasons. The data requirements and potential bias in estimated baseflow index ({BFI}) were evaluated using conductivity data for different seasons and/or resampled data segments at various sampling durations. Results indicated that the data collected during ground-frozen season are more suitable to estimate baseflow conductivity (Cbf) and data during snow-melting period are more suitable to estimate runoff conductivity (Cro). Relative errors of baseflow estimation were inversely proportional to the number of conductivity data records. A minimum of six-month discharge and conductivity data is required to obtain reliable parameters for current method with acceptable errors. We further found that the average annual recharge rate for the {BBW} was 322 mm in the past twenty years.},

A relatively overlooked aspect of this uncertainty pertains to how different methods of estimating potential evapotranspiration ({PET}) respond to changing climate. Here we investigate the global response of six different {PET} methods to a 2°C rise in global mean temperature. All methods suggest an increase in {PET} associated with a warming climate. However, differences in {PET} climate change signal of over 100\% are found between methods. Analysis of a precipitation/{PET} aridity index and regional water surplus indicates that for certain regions and {GCMs}, choice of {PET} method can actually determine the direction of projections of future water resources. As such, method dependence of the {PET} climate change signal is an important source of uncertainty in projections of future freshwater availability.},

As measuring the baseflow component directly is difficult, various analytical and empirical baseflow separation methods have been developed and tested. The recursive digital filter ({RDF}) method is commonly used for baseflow separation due to its simplicity and low data requirement. However, parameters used in the {RDF} method are often determined arbitrarily, resulting in high uncertainty of the estimated baseflow rate. A more accurate method is the conductivity mass balance ({CMB}) method, which is established based on the differences in physical processes between baseflow and surface runoff. In this research, the output of the {CMB} method was used to calibrate the parameters of an {RDF} model, and the calibrated {RDF} model was used to estimate monthly, seasonal and annual baseflow rate and baseflow index for the past 19 years using streamflow discharge records. The characteristics of the baseflow hydrographs were found to be consistent with the hydrological and hydrogeological conditions of the research area. Research results indicated that the accuracy of the {RDF} model has been greatly enhanced after being calibrated with the {CMB} method so that the {RDF} model can provide more reliable baseflow separation results for a long-term study.

	abstract = {This paper evaluates the sensitivity of hydrological projections to the choice of potential evapotranspiration formulas on two natural sub-catchments, in Canada and Germany. Twenty-four equations, representing a large range of options, are applied for calibration over the whole observation time series and for future conditions. The modelling chain is composed of dynamically downscaled climatic projections and a 20-member (ensemble) hydrological model, along with a snow module. The roots of the sensitivity and its propagation within the hydrological chain are evaluated to show influences on climate change impact conclusions. Results show large differences between the 24 simulated potential evapotranspiration time series. However, these discrepancies only moderately affect the calibration efficiency of hydrological models as a result of adaptation of parameters. Choice of formula influences hydrological projections and climate change conclusions for both catchments in terms of simulated and projected values, and also in the magnitude of changes during important dynamic periods such as spring and autumn high flows and summer low flows. Spread of the hydrological response is lower for the combinational formulas than for temperature-based or radiation-based equations. All the results reveal the importance of testing a large spectrum of potential evapotranspiration formulas in a decision-making context, such as water resources management.},

	abstract = {A multi-class, phytoplankton simulation model was developed and calibrated to an extensive set of field data acquired on Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron, during 1974. Phytoplankton biomass was partitioned into five functional groups: diatoms, greens, non-N2-fixing blue-greens, N2-fixing blue-greens, and “others”. Nutrients included in the model were phosphorus, nitrogen, and silicon. The model was applied to a single spatial segment encompassing the inner portion of Saginaw Bay. Process level analyses were conducted with the calibrated model to determine the relative importance of various factors affecting phytoplankton and nutrient dynamics. The concept of a single limiting factor for phytoplankton growth was found to be overly simplistic. Results indicated that temperature and light were relatively more growth rate limiting than nutrients on an annual average basis. However, as a consequence of nutrient depletion, nutrients became relatively more important at the times of peak phytoplankton crops. Nitrogen was found to be relatively more growth rate limiting than phosphorus to the total phytoplankton crop, although important differences occurred among the individual functional groups. At various times, and for various groups, all three nutrients were important in limiting either the rates of growth and/or the maximum sizes of the phytoplankton crops. Results were consistent with the hypothesis that while nitrogen and silicon were important in phytoplankton-nutrient dynamics, the supply of phosphorus would ultimately determine the size of the blue-green component of the total crop because N2-fixing blue-greens do not have absolute requirements for dissolved available nitrogen or silicon. Results indicated that phosphorus requirements of spring and fall diatom crops were satisfied primarily by external loadings. Phosphorus requirements of summer blue-green crops were satisfied primarily by recycle processes within the water column. Upon cell death, direct nutrient recycle to the available nutrient compartments in the water column from excess internal phytoplankton stores was found to be important for both phosphorus and nitrogen. Phytoplankton production was found to be extremely sensitive to variations in the light extinction coefficient in the water column, and relatively insensitive to variations in incident solar radiation.},

	abstract = {The isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen have been used extensively as indicators of groundwater age (3H) and paleotemperature of groundwater recharge (18O/16O, 2H/1H); however, comparisons of values in groundwater with those in recent precipitation are few. This study describes and interprets the isotopic composition of precipitation in central Iowa for the year 1992. An unusually mild winter driven by south-westerly flow of the jet stream was followed by an unusually cool and predominantly dry summer that was caused by a persistent northwesterly flow in the upper atmosphere. Temperature was below normal (9.0°C); precipitation was above normal (868.4 mm) and was mostly derived from a Gulf of Mexico moisture source. Fifty-one precipitation samples were collected from 37 events and analyzed for hydrogen and oxygen isotopes. Tritium activities ranged from 0 to 44 tritium units ({TU}) and the weighted mean 3H activity was 11.02 {TU}, a value consistent with International Atomic Energy Agency ({IAEA}) data. Anomalously high 3H activities suggested input of technogenic 3H. Weighted mean values of δ18O and δ2H were −8.02‰ and −53.62‰, respectively, and the equation of the local Meteoric Water Line was δ2H=9.26δ18O + 4.65. Weighted mean δ18O and δ2H values from the Gulf-Pacific moisture source (−10.80‰, −74.82‰) were more depleted than those ascribed solely to a Gulf of Mexico moisture source (−7.24‰, −47.39‰). Seasonal differences in temperature primarily controlled these differences in isotopic composition.},

	abstract = {Potential evapotranspiration models very often are important part of hydrological catchment models to calculate potential evapotranspiration ({PET}) which then is used to estimate actual evapotranspiration considering the soil moisture status. As many different approaches exist, the question arises in which way the choice of the {PET} model affects the impact of climate change on the calculated water balance? Therefore, 18 different {PET} models were compared with respect to their sensitivity to observed climate change. Long-term climate data of six German climate stations were used to identify changes in the climate data itself and changes in the calculated {PET}. The results show that all investigated {PET} models are sensitive to significant trends in climate data. However, it is also shown that all models show different sensitivities, and that the sensitivities cannot be grouped in terms of different types of {PET} models such as the aerodynamic concept, radiation or temperature based approaches and combination equations. Predominantly, the variability within a group of models of the same type is comparable to the variability between different model types. Therefore it can be concluded that {PET} models should be validated in a regional context before they are applied to a certain region within a climate change study despite the poor availability of long-term {PET} measurements.},

As in all sciences, many have been attracted to it simply because of its newness. Another class—and the one that has participated most eagerly—is composed of those intrepid practicing engineers who are obliged to make the runoff estimates upon which depend the failure or success of costly flood control, water supply, and similar works. Still another group has been intrigued by a purely scientific interest, sharpened by the fact that the calculation of runoff is the central problem of the science of hydrology and involves all phases of the hydrologic cycle. Among these are scientists in the fields of soils, plants, and meteorology. As a result of these various motivations, vast amounts of labor have been expended—much of it misdirected—and many exaggerated claims have been made, to be countered, naturally, by the disparaging murmurs of the “old guard,” and other important lines of investigation have been temporarily slighted. But real progress has been made. Better estimates of runoff are now possible than could be made previously. Problems that would not yield at all to earlier methods are now soluble, albeit the solutions are sometimes only rough approximations. The inescapable conclusion is that a tool of considerable practical value has been added to the equipment of the hydrologist.},

	abstract = {Given the large share of the water budget contributed by evapotranspiration ({ET}), accurately estimating {ET} is critical for hydro-climate change studies. Routinely, hydrologic models use temperature proxy relationships to estimate potential evapotranspiration ({PET}) when forced using {GCM}/{RCM} projections of precipitation and temperature. A limitation of this approach is that the temperature proxy relationships do not account for the conservation of energy needed to estimate {ET} consistently in climate change scenarios. In particular, {PET} methods using temperature as a proxy fail to account for the negative feedback of {ET} on surface temperature. Using several {GCM} projections and a hydrologic model developed for the Great Lakes basin watersheds, the {NOAA} Large Basin Runoff Model ({LBRM}), the importance of maintaining a consistent energy budget in hydrologic and climate models is demonstrated by comparing runoff projections from temperature proxy and energy conservation methods. Differences in hydrologic responses are related to watershed characteristics, hydrologic model parameters and climate variables. It is shown that the temperature proxy approach consistently leads to prediction of relatively large and potentially unrealistic reductions in runoff. Therefore, hydrologic projections adhering to energy conservation principles are recommended for use in climate change impact studies.},

Recent mathematical work, although repetitive to some extent of the earlier efforts, has the advantage that it assesses more closely the effects of the simplifying assumptions used to obtain solutions. Most workers have preferred to follow graphical or statistical rather than mathematical approaches. The reasons appear to lie mainly in problems caused by the assumptions and in difficulties in interpreting the real stream hydrograph. Also, base flow can come from numerous sources besides ground water. Other complications arise from the question of whether the basin response is linear or nonlinear, because the response is a function of various geologic and hydrologic factors in addition to those considered in the mathematical derivations.},

	abstract = {The western United States is a region long defined by water challenges. Climate change adds to those historical challenges, but does not, for the most part, introduce entirely new challenges; rather climate change is likely to stress water supplies and resources already in many cases stretched to, or beyond, natural limits. Projections are for continued and, likely, increased warming trends across the region, with a near certainty of continuing changes in seasonality of snowmelt and streamflows, and a strong potential for attendant increases in evaporative demands. Projections of future precipitation are less conclusive, although likely the northernmost West will see precipitation increases while the southernmost West sees declines. However, most of the region lies in a broad area where some climate models project precipitation increases while others project declines, so that only increases in precipitation uncertainties can be projected with any confidence. Changes in annual and seasonal hydrographs are likely to challenge water managers, users, and attempts to protect or restore environmental flows, even where annual volumes change little. Other impacts from climate change (e.g., floods and water-quality changes) are poorly understood and will likely be location dependent. In this context, four iconic river basins offer glimpses into specific challenges that climate change may bring to the West. The Colorado River is a system in which overuse and growing demands are projected to be even more challenging than climate-change-induced flow reductions. The Rio Grande offers the best example of how climate-change-induced flow declines might sink a major system into permanent drought. The Klamath is currently projected to face the more benign precipitation future, but fisheries and irrigation management may face dire straits due to warming air temperatures, rising irrigation demands, and warming waters in a basin already hobbled by tensions between endangered fisheries and agricultural demands. Finally, California's Bay-Delta system is a remarkably localized and severe weakness at the heart of the region's trillion-dollar economy. It is threatened by the full range of potential climate-change impacts expected across the West, along with major vulnerabilities to increased flooding and rising sea levels.},
