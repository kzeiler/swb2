# Example Applications {#example_applications}

Two applications are included here. The first example application forms the base test case for our incorporation of some of the Hawaii Water Budget code features: the Hawaiian Island of Maui. The second example application demonstrates the application of SWBâ€™s crop water demand / irrigation estimation capabilities to the Little Plover River in central Wisconsin. The Little Plover River example is also designed to demonstrate that the SWB 2.0 code generates very similar estimates to those produced by SWB 1.0.
