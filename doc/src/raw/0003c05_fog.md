#### Fog

Fog interception is not explicitly modeled within SWB 2.0, but estimates of fog interception may e supplied by means of externally generated grid files. For pilot application of the new code to Maui, Hawaii (discussed elsewhere in this document), a set of external grids were developed. These grids express the intercepted fog amounts as a fraction of the monthly observed rainfall amounts. The process involves a grid computation using the aspect, elevation, and mean monthly rainfall combined with table values of estimated annual fog interception rates to yield monthly fog interception grids expressed as a fraction of monthly rainfall amounts.
