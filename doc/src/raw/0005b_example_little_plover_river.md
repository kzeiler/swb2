## Little Plover River, Wisconsin {#example_little_plover_river_wisconsin}

The Little Plover River (LPR) runs for 21 miles and is located in the Central Sands region of Wisconsin [@henrich_drainage-area_1983]. The river is listed as a Class 1 trout stream for much of its length. Increasing numbers of high-capacity wells have been installed over the past 30 years to irrigate vegetable crops in the region. Summertime low flows in the Little Plover River have, as a result, been dropping; in some years, the discharge in July or August has dropped to zero.

In 2014, SWB (version 1.0) was applied to the Little Plover River in support of a groundwater study conducted jointly by the USGS and by the Wisconsin State Geological and Natural History Survey. SWB was used to estimate irrigation demand given the crops present, as well as to calculate potential recharge for use in an underlying MODFLOW model.
