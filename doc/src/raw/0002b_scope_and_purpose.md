# Scope and Purpose {#scope}

This report documents changes made to the SWB 1.0 code since the original publication was issued, and use and operation of the SWB 2.0 code. Every effort has been made to ensure that control file statements operate in an identical fashion between the two codes. Features that exist in only one of the two codes are labeled as such.

The theoretical basis, data requirements for use, and limitations and assumptions relating to the two SWB codes are presented in this report. In addition, two test cases are provided. The first test case (Maui, Hawaii) confirms the performance of the SWB code relative to the Hawaii Water Budget code. The second test case demonstrates the application of the SWB code to the Little Plover River in Wisconsin, and compares the output of the two codes. Appendixes to this document contain a complete listing of control file directives and a description of input and output files use with SWB 1.0 and 2.0.
