# Abstract {#abstract}

The USGS Soil-Water-Balance (SWB) model was developed as a tool to enable scientists and engineers to estimate the distribution and timing of groundwater recharge relatively quickly and easily. The original SWB 1.0 model calculates recharge (or more accurately, net infiltration) by use of commonly available geographic information system (GIS) data layers in combination with tabular climatological data. The code is based on a modified Thornthwaite-Mather soil-water-balance approach, with components of the soil-water balance calculated at a daily timestep. Recharge calculations are made on a rectangular grid of computational elements that may be easily imported into a regional groundwater-flow model. Recharge estimates calculated by the code may be output as daily, monthly, or annual values. The code described in this document (SWB 2.0) extends the original work by adding new process options and data input output capabilities.
