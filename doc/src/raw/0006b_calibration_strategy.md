## Calibration Strategy {#calibration_strategy} 

[TOC]

Actual recharge rates for a study area are generally unknown; none of the methods available to us offer recharge estimates of known accuracy. Healy [-@healy_estimating_2010] suggests that because of the uncertainty inherent in all current recharge estimation methods, there "are no standards that can be used to evaluate the accuracy of recharge estimates."
