### Snowmelt {#snowmelt}

[TOC]

Snowmelt is based on a temperature-index method. In the SWB code it is assumed that 1.5 mm (0.059 in.) of water-equivalent snow melts per day per average degree Celsius that the daily maximum temperature is above the freezing point [@dripps_simple_2007].

$$potential\;snowmelt = 0.059 \cdot ({T_{\max }} - 32)$$ {#eq:potential_snowmelt}
