### Snowfall {#snowfall}

[TOC]

Snow is allowed to accumulate and/or melt on a daily basis. The daily mean, maximum, and minimum air temperatures are used to determine whether precipitation takes the form of rain or snow. Precipitation that falls on a day when the mean temperature minus one-third the difference between the daily high and low temperatures is less than or equal to the freezing point of water is considered to fall as snow [@dripps_simple_2007].

$$T_{\mean}  - \frac{1}{3}\left( {{T_{\max }} - {T_{\min }}} \right) < 32$$ {#eq:snow_def_simple}

where
  $T_{\mean}$ is the mean daily air temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit, and 
  $T_{\max}$, $T_{\min}$ are the daily maximum and minimum air temperatures, in degrees Fahrenheit.
