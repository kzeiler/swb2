title: Method Documentation

Each of the hydrologic processes that are part of the water budget can
be simulated in one or more ways; Soil-Water-Balance (SWB) has a
collection of methods that implement the processes included in the water
budget. The user may select which method to use depending on which is
most applicable to the problem at hand.
