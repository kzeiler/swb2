title: Fog Interception

## Fog Interception

Fog interception is not explicitly modeled within SWB, but estimates of
fog interception may be supplied by means of externally generated grid
files. For pilot application of SWB to Maui, Hawaii, a set of external
grids were developed. These grids express the intercepted fog amounts as
a fraction of the monthly observed rainfall amounts. The process
involves a grid computation using the aspect, elevation, and mean
monthly rainfall combined with table values of estimated annual
fog-interception rates to yield monthly fog-interception grids expressed
as a fraction of monthly rainfall amounts. More details on this external
fog calculation are in appendix 4, along with example input files.
